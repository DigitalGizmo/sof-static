            <P CLASS="segment_title">Introduction</P>
            <P CLASS="bigbody">These lessons are designed to serve as examples 
              of different ways you can use the 1704 website with students. The 
              lessons cover a range of topics, with the goal of helping students 
              to personalize their study of the people involved in the Raid. Students 
              are asked to study the raid from a variety of perspectives, using 
              both primary and secondary sources. <strong>Primary sources</strong> 
              were written during the time being studied. <strong>Secondary sources</strong> 
              were written after the fact, but the author may have studied a primary 
              source to produce the secondary source. Because the text of the 
              site is written at an adult level, most of the lessons are best 
              used with upper elementary through high school students. One lesson,<em> 
              </em><strong>We Both Want to Use this Land</strong>, is specifically 
              designed for younger elementary children. Although most of the lessons 
              cover the topics of colonial and Native American U.S. history, two 
              lessons, <strong>Making Tracks to Canada</strong> and <strong>A 
              Map and Math Lesson with Jonathan Hoyt</strong>, involve geography, 
              mapping, and math skills. At the end of each lesson is a list of 
              resources for further information. We encourage teachers to incorporate 
              their own resources as well.</P>

            <p class="bigbody">"Living on the Edge of Empire: Alliance, Conflict and Captivity in Colonial New England" were two National Endowment for the Humanities Landmarks Workshops held in Deerfield, Massachusetts the summers of 2013 and 2016. Presented by the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association, the workshops placed the 1704 Raid on Deerfield in the broader context of the history of colonial New England. The educators who participated in the workshop each produced a lesson, some of which are presented here.  The workshop website is at: <a href="http://edge-empire.deerfield-ma.org/" target="_blank">http://edge-empire.deerfield-ma.org/</a>
