              <li>First, make some observations about W&ocirc;banaki houses W&ocirc;banaki 
                land use. You will find information in <strong>Meet the Five Cultures</strong>, 
                <strong>Explanations</strong>, and <strong>Artifacts</strong> 
                on the 1704 website. As you read about W&ocirc;banaki homes and 
                land use, ask yourself the following questions and take notes 
                for your answers. Be prepared to discuss your answers to these 
                questions in class. <br>
                <br>
                Here's what you should look at to find your information: 
                <blockquote> &#8226; <a href="../scenes/groups.html"><strong>Meet 
                  the Five Cultures</strong></a> - W&ocirc;banaki - Click <strong>Learn

                  Examine the first picture closely.<br>
                   <a href="../artifacts/index.html"><strong>Artifacts</strong></a> 
                  - click <strong>Structures/Architectural Elements</strong>, 
                  then click <strong>Wigwam</strong>.<br>
                   <a href="../background/index.html"><strong>Explanations</strong></a> 
                  - click <strong>Native Land Use and Settlements in the Northeastern 
                  Woodlands</strong> and read the following sections: Algonkian 
                  Homelands, English Deeds and Native Lands. 
                  <p class="bigbody">Think about these questions:</p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="bigbody">Housing:<br>
                      a. What is this structure made of?<br>
                      b. How did these people get their building materials?<br>
                      c. What impact was made in the immediate surroundings in 
                      order to build this house?<br>
                      d. In the future when the house is gone, what will remain 
                      on its site? Will there be any way to know that a structure 
                      was there? </p>
                    <p class="bigbody">Land Use:<br>
                      a. In what ways did the W&ocirc;banakiak use the land?<br>
                      b. How did they alter the landscape?<br>
                      c. Did they move their homes and villages around or stay 
                      in one spot? Why?<br>
                      d. How did the W&ocirc;banaki connection to the land affect 
                      what they did to it. </p>
                  </blockquote>
                </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>Now, go to the <strong><a href="../maps/index.html">Maps Menu</a></strong> 
                on the 1704 website and click the last link, <strong>The Deerfield/Pocumtuck 
                Area</strong>. Examine the first illustration of Pocumtuck, circa 
                1550 and read the text. Answer the following questions: 
                <blockquote> a. Why is this a good site for a home?<br>
                  b. Are all of the homes located in one area? </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>Next, you will be making observations about the land use and 
                houses of the English settlers in Deerfield. Go to the American 
                Centuries website (www.americancenturies.mass.edu) to access the 
                curriculum titled: <a href="#stay" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('http://memorialhall.mass.edu/classroom/curriculum_6th/lesson4/index.html','AmericanCenturies','location=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,width=600,height=400')"><strong>Everyday 
                Life in a New England Town - Lesson #4, The Homes, Possessions,

                Click Part 6: <strong>The Wells-Thorn House</strong>, then click 
                the first photo of the Wells-Thorn House, <strong>Outside</strong>, 
                down on the right side under the Materials in Context section. 
                Examine the photo carefully and answer the following questions: 
                <blockquote> a. What is this structure made of?<br>
                  b. How did these people get their building materials?<br>
                  c. What kind of impact was made in the immediate surroundings 
                  in order to build this house?<br>
                  d. After the house is gone, what will remain on its site? Will 
                  there be any way to know that a structure was there? </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>Go to the <a href="../background/index.html"><strong>Explanations 
                Menu</strong></a> then clicking <strong>European Land Use and 
                the Transformation of the Northeast</strong>. Read from the beginning 
                up to the section titled French Acquisition of Lands. Also read 
                the following sections: English Acquisition of Lands, Native Deeds, 
                Establishing Towns, and English Use of Lands. Ask yourself the 
                following questions: 
                <blockquote> a. In what ways did the English use the land?<br>
                  b. How did they alter the landscape?<br>
                  c. Did they move their homes and villages around, or stay in 
                  one spot? Why?<br>
                  d. Note how their connection to the land affected what they 
                  did to it. </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>Go to the <a href="../maps/index.html"><strong>Maps Menu</strong></a> 
                on the 1704 website and click the last link, <strong>The Deerfield/Pocumtuck 
                Area</strong>. Examine the second illustration, Deerfield, circa 
                1700, and read the text. Answer the following questions:</li>
              <blockquote> a. Why is this a good site for a home?<br>
                b. Are all of the homes located in one area? </blockquote>
              <li>Compare your answers in numbers 1 through 3 above. Do you think 
                the Pocumtuck and English settlers would have gotten along well 
                living in the same area? Why or why not?</li>
              <li>Go to the <a href="../artifacts/index.html"><strong>Artifacts 
                Menu</strong></a> on the 1704 website and choose <strong>Historic 
                Documents</strong>, then <strong>Chauk Deed</strong>. Do not read 
                the text accompanying the deed yet. You can read a typed version 
                of the deed by clicking <strong>Text Transcription</strong>. Read 
                the transcription and answer the following questions:</li>
              <blockquote> a. Who sold the land to whom?<br>
                b. Were any rights reserved? If so, what were they?<br>
                c. Were any protections put in place? If so, what were they? </blockquote>
              <li>Now read the text accompanying the deed. Although the Pocumtuck 
                had strong relationships with the land, they believed&#8212;unlike 
                Europeans&#8212;that the land could not be owned. With that in 
                mind, what might they have understood about the following phrases 
                from the deed? 
                <blockquote> a. &quot;hath Given Granted Bargained & sold&quot;<br>
                  b. &quot;Have Hold & Injoy & that forever&quot;<br>
                  d. &quot;And the sd Chaque...will saue ye sd Major Lusher & 
                  Danl ffisher, therire Associates & theire heires & assignes, 
                  Harmless or &amp; from all manner of Claimes of any person or 
                  persons Lawfully claiming any right Title or Interest in any 
                  of ye sd lands hereby Sold...&quot; </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>The deed states that Chauk could continue fishing, hunting and 
                gathering nuts in the area to be sold, but he was also expected 
                to &quot;Defend the same from any molestations or Incumbrances 
                by Indians otherwise than as before reserved.&quot; What do you 
                think the English understood or wanted when they wrote these statements 
                into the deed?<br>
              </li>
              <li>What were the problems with this land transaction?<br>
              </li>
              <li>Think back over all that you have learned in this lesson. In 
                what ways do you think there were incompatible ideas of land use 
                by the W&ocirc;banakiak and English? </li>
