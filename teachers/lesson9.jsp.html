									<p class="bigbody"><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
									In this lesson, students compare two women's lives across cultures in times of unrest in Massachusetts in the late 17th century. They begin to understand that differences in values, roles and needs can cause problems and that different cultures deal with these problems in different ways. They gain an awareness of multiple perspectives and solutions to problems.</p>

									How did Eunice Mather Williams and Weetanusk think and feel about the Peskeompskut Assault?</p>

									<ol class="bigbody">
									  <li>Go to the <strong><a href="../scenes/index.html">Story Menu</a></strong> on the 1704 website and click <strong>Assault on Peskeompskut</strong>. Read the Overview tab, the English tab, and the W&ocirc;banaki tab.
                    </li>
                    <li>Go to the <a href="../people/index.html"><strong>People Menu</strong></a>, find <strong>Weetanusk</strong> and <strong>Eunice Mather Williams</strong>, and read about them. Read up to the section titled &quot;1704,&quot; of Eunice's character narrative.
										</li>
                    <li>Go to the <a href="../artifacts/index.html"><strong>Artifacts Menu</strong></a> and look in the <strong>Personal Items/Clothing</strong> and <strong>Household Objects</strong> sections to find items these women might have owned.

                    <li>If students are using computers in class, instruct them to complete the <a href="lesson9_student.jsp.html"><strong>Student Activity Sheet</strong></a> for this lesson. If they will be using computers elsewhere, either give them the Student Activity Sheet URL (http://1704.deerfield.history.museum/teachers/lesson9_student.jsp), or print the Student Activity Sheet and distribute copies to students.</li>
                    <li>Hold a class discussion, making sure to cover all of the points listed in For Class Discussion below.</li>

									<p class="menu">For Class Discussion</p>
									<ol class="bigbody">
                    <li>What did each of these women have in common? If they could have met, what parts of the other's life would each have understood? (For example, fear of attack) What parts might they not have understood? (For example, why the Native people wouldn't leave an area the English felt they owned; why the English attacked Peskeompskut.)
										</li>
                    <li>Think about how each woman might have felt about the Peskeompskut Assault.  Return to <strong>Assault on Peskeompskut</strong>. Read the Overview, and the English and W&ocirc;banaki points of view. Be prepared to discuss the following questions in class:
											<blockquote>
											a.) Although there is no mention of the Assault on Peskeompskut in Eunice's character narrative, you can gain general information about how her people felt about it by reading the Overview and English tabs. What might Eunice have said about why the assault happened? What did she and her people feel they needed in order to survive? How did they feel threatened? Were they wrong?  Why or why not?<br>
											b.) What would Weetanusk have said about why the assault happened? To her and her people, what was wrong about it? What did they feel they needed in order to survive? How did they feel threatened? Were they wrong? Why or why not?
