                    Both European and Native peoples left distinctive imprints 
                    on the land. In addition, each group wanted to use the same 
                    land in different ways. In this lesson, students learn about 
                    differences between these ideas of land use by closely examining 
                    artwork that depicts homes, communities, and surrounding landscapes 
                    from each culture. </p>

                      circa 1550, and read the text. Next, examine the second

                      on the 1704 website and click <strong>The Deerfield/Pocumtuck 
                      Area</strong>. Project on a screen (or hand out colored 
                      copies) the first two views, Pocumtuck, circa 1550, and 
                      Deerfield, circa 1700. If projecting, show the 1550 view 
                      first. </LI>
                    <LI> As students examine the 1550 view and tell them that 
                      this was part of the homeland of the Pocumtucks, the Native 
                      people who lived in and around Deerfield. Ask: 
                      <blockquote>
									a. What might the Pocumtucks have liked about living in this spot?<br>
									b. How are they using the land in this picture?  List the activities that people are involved in.<br>

									d. How did they change the area to make life easier? How much of this can you figure out by looking at the picture?

                    <LI>
									Now have students study the 1700 view, and ask:
     							    <blockquote>
									a. Is this the same spot? How can you tell? This is how the area looked when the English settlers moved in.<br>
									b. What might the English have liked about living in this spot?<br>
									c. How are they using the land? List the activities that people are involved in.<br>
									d. What is the land giving them?<br>
									e. How did they change the area to make life easier?
     							</blockquote>
                    </LI>
                    <LI>
									Now compare the two views with the class. Ask:
     							    <blockquote>
     							a. What are the differences between the two views?<br>
                        b. Why did the English build fences? There would have 
                        been a very long fence around the whole planting area. 
                        Why didn't the Pocumtucks build any fences?<br>
                        c. If you were a Pocumtuck who was still in the area after 
                        the English settled there, how would you get from the 
                        woods to the river? Remember that there are fences in 
                        the way. Do you think the English would be mad if you 
                        climbed their fences and walked across their planted fields? 
                        What would you tell them?<br>
     							d. The English usually did not keep their pigs in pens, but allowed them to roam wherever they wanted. As a Pocumtuck, what would you say and do if the English pigs got into your cornfield? If you were the pigs' owner, what would you say? The English were supposed to pay for any damages to crops caused by their animals. Is this a good enough solution?<br>
                        e. The Pocumtucks didn't keep animals such as pigs, sheep, 
                        cows or chickens. They hunted and fished instead, and 
                        this involved a lot of walking and moving of their homes. 
                        The English stayed put in one spot. Can you think of how 
                        these two groups could have lived together in the same 
                        spot? What do you think really happened between the English 
                        and the Pocumtucks in the Deerfield area? </blockquote>
