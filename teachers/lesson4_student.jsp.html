              <li>Jonathan Hoyt was one of the children taken captive from Deerfield in the 1704 attack. He was born in April of 1688. How old was he in February of 1704?  
</li>
              <li>Go to the <strong><a href="../people/index.html">People Menu</a></strong> of the 1704 website and click <strong>Jonathan Hoyt</strong>. Read about his life.
</li>
                            
              <li>Click the <strong>Parting Ways</strong> section at the top of 
                Jonathan Hoyt's character narrative. In the second paragraph of 
                Parting Ways, click <strong>place</strong> to familiarize yourself 
                with the map of <strong>The March to Canada</strong>. Find the 
                location where the captives were on March 8, where the Connecticut 
                River and White River meet. Using the scale of miles, estimate 
                the distance between this spot and Deerfield. </li>
                            
              <li>Go to the <strong onClick="MM_openBrWindow('http://mapquest.com/directions/','MapQuest','toolbar=yes,location=yes,status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=400')" onMouseClick="MM_openBrWindow('http://mapquest.com/directions/','MapQuest','toolbar=yes,location=yes,status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=400')"><a href="#">MapQuest</a></strong> website (http://mapquest.com/directions/).  Type in &quot;Deerfield, MA,&quot; for Start, and White River Junction, VT, for End, then click Get Directions. At the bottom of the directions, find the mileage. How did you do?
</li>
                            
              <li>The captives walked for eight days to reach the junction of the Connecticut and White rivers. Figure out about how many miles they walked per day. Stephen Williams (whom you can also read about from the <strong><a href="../people/index.html">People Menu</a></strong>), said he thought they were made to walk 35-40 miles a day. In reality, their longest walk was about 24 miles. How does the walk to the White River compare to the longest walk?  Create a fraction that shows this comparison. 
</li>
              <li>Today, according to the Mapquest search, it takes 1 hour and 35 minutes to drive from Deerfield to White River Junction. Follow the steps below to create a fraction that compares the captives' walking time to today's driving time:  
                <blockquote> a. First, we'll guess that the captives walked an 
                  average of 10 hours per day. How many hours would they walk 
                  in eight days? How many minutes would that be?<br>
                  b. Now convert 1 hour and 35 minutes all to minutes.<br>
                  c. Create your fraction and simplify it as much as possible. 
                  Approximately, how much faster is it to drive? Divide 960 by 
                  19. Now round off the answer to a whole number. </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>While a captive, Jonathan lived with the Wendat (Huron) people 
                in the town of Lorette (Wendake). To find out how far away from 
                home he was, go to the <strong>Epilogue</strong> section of the 
                <strong>Jonathan Hoyt</strong> narrative, and click <strong>Quebec</strong>. 
                Find <strong>Wendake/Lorette</strong> on the map and using the 
                scale of miles, estimate the distance from Deerfield to Lorette, 
                as the crow flies. Now go back to the Mapquest website. Keep your 
                Start information the same but type in <strong>Lorette, QC</strong>, 
                for End. You will find the mileage at the bottom of the page. 
                How did you do? </li>
              <li>William Dudley, the son of the governor of Massachusetts, found 
                Jonathan and paid his master 20 silver dollars in order to return 
                Jonathan to Deerfield. These silver dollars were Spanish milled 
                dollars, which were not used in the colony of Massachusetts. The 
                colony used pounds, shillings and pence. See if you can convert 
                20 Spanish milled dollars to the Massachusetts system of money: 
                <blockquote> a. One Spanish milled dollar = 6 shillings. How many 
                  shillings make 20 silver dollars?<br>
                  b. Twenty shillings = 1 pound. Convert your answer to question 
                  "a" to pounds. </blockquote>
