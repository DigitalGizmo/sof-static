                  <p><strong>Teaching the Lesson</strong></p>
                  <p> 1. Direct students to go to the 1704 website and examine 
                    the <strong><a href="../scenes/scene/%22Peskeompskut%22.html">Assault 
                    on Peskeompskut</a></strong> (also known as the Falls Fight) 
                    scene and read about this attack. They should then read about 
                    the <strong>Bloody Brook Massacre</strong> on the <strong>English</strong> 
                    tab. Finally, they should also read the <strong>Overview</strong> 
                    tab and the <strong>Wobanaki</strong> tab.</p>
                  <p>2. Divide students into small groups and assign half the groups to study the Bloody Brook Massacre, and the other half to study the Falls Fight. Distribute the readings listed above to the appropriate groups.</p>
                  <p>3. Tell students they will be gathering information about the two attacks in small groups, using primary and secondary sources.  Explain that the groups should divide up the readings so that each student has at least one.  Each student should skim his/her readings and highlight information about:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>&#8226; How the battles were carried out (who did what and when)<br>
                      &#8226; What the results of the battles were (e.g. how many 
                      people died or were wounded)<br>
                      &#8226; The language used to describe the attacks and the attackers</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>4. Distribute the appropriate <strong>Battle Summary Worksheet</strong> for each student to complete.</p>
                  <p>5. Hold a class discussion to review findings. During the 
                    discussion, help students understand the connotation of words 
                    like &quot;fight&quot; and &quot;massacre.&quot; Also, note 
                    that there are discrepancies in the numbers of attackers, 
                    those who died, etc. This issue is addressed in the <strong>1704 
                    Teachers' Guide</strong> lesson <strong><a href="lesson6.jsp.html">Numbers 
                    That Don't Add Up</a></strong>. Ask:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>a. Why are there discrepancies in the numbers of attackers, 
                      those who died, etc.?<br>
                      b. In the Bloody Brook Massacre, how are the victims viewed?<br>
                      c. In the Falls Fight, how are the victims viewed?<br>
                      d. Compare the words that describe the victims and attackers 
                      in each case. Which show more negative language? Why?<br>
                      e. The attack at Bloody Brook has been known over the years 
                      as a &quot;massacre,&quot; and the attack at the &quot;Falls&quot; 
                      has been known as a &quot;fight.&quot; Which attack had 
                      more victims? Which attack resulted in more deaths? In each 
                      attack, did either victim group fight back?<br>
                      f. In a dictionary, look up the definitions for &quot;fight&quot; 
                      and &quot;massacre.&quot;<br>
                      g. Should either attack be called a &quot;massacre&quot;? 
                      Why or why not?</p>
