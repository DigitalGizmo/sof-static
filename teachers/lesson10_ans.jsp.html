						<li>Eunice's treatment - carried by captor, given better shoes, let her stay near family on walk, let her ride on sled, treated gently.

            <li>Stephen's treatment - given better shoes, took away his silver buttons and buckles, torn away from his family and all other English people.

            <li>Eunice's names:  Waongote  meaning, &quot;they took her and placed her as a member of their tribe&quot;; Kanenstenhawi  meaning, &quot;she brings in corn.&quot;  Stephen was not given a new name because no one adopted him.</li><br><br>

                <dd>a. Thaowentsawakon joined the raid to find a child to adopt 
                  to replace a niece who had died of smallpox; Wattanummon joined 
                  the raid to get back at the English for wrongs they had committed 
                  against his people.</dd>
							  
                <dd>b. Thaowentsawakon's treatment of Eunice - gave her moccasins, 
                  smiled at her, spoke kind words even though she did not understand, 
                  carried her, treated her kindly. Wattanummon's treatment of 
                  Stephen - gave him moccasins, kept him from drowning, kept him 
                  from being killed by others, showed Stephen how to eat yokeg 
                  without choking, was stern with him and sometimes treated him 
                  roughly, punished Stephen for calling out loudly when Stephen 
                  got lost in the woods.</dd>
							
                <dd>c). Thaowentsawakon gave Eunice to his sister, who adopted 
                  her. Wattanummon gave Stephen to his friend, George Tahanto.</li>

                <dd>a. Stephen's complaints and feelings - his captors were liars; 
                  they murdered children; he was made to travel too far too fast; 
                  he had sore and frostbitten feet; he was hungry, frightened, 
                  angry, uneasy, desolate.</dd>
							  
                <dd>b. Stephen preferred to be with the French because they were 
                  kind to him, pitied him, fed him bread and other food, dressed 
                  the wounds on his feet, and let him lie down on a &quot;couch.&quot;</dd>
							  
                <dd>c. Most likely Stephen was redeemed because he did not adapt 
                  well to his captors' way of life and, as a child of the town's 
                  minister, John Williams, he would have been heavily pursued 
                  to return to New England.</dd>

                <dd>a. Eunice's complaints and feelings - she had trouble keeping 
                  up; she was afraid; she felt comforted by being allowed to stay 
                  near her family on part of the march; she felt fortunate, sorry 
                  for her father, sad.</dd>
							  
                <dd>b. Eunice made a good adoptee because she didn't complain 
                  very much; she didn't fight back; she felt fortunate and was 
                  able to overcome some of her fear; her captor may have noticed 
                  her helpfulness in caring for her little brother on the sled. 
                  As a young girl, she was still impressionable and more easily 
                  converted to Catholicism and the Kanienkehaka way of life.</dd>
