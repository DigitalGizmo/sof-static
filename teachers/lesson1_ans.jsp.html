              <p>a. The Pocumtucks might have liked the flat land for growing crops 
                and traveling; being near the water for traveling and drinking 
                water; having the woods nearby for lumber, firewood and houses; 
                and game for hunting. </p>
              <p>b. People are walking, canoeing, farming, burning the forest to 
                clear it, living in houses. </p>
              <p>c. The land is giving them wood, water, plants, game animals. </p>
              <p>d. They made life easier by establishing trails, clearing the forest, 
                building homes, and cultivating crops. </p>

                and traveling; being near the water for traveling and drinking

                building fences, establishing fields for crops. </p>

              <p>a. Differences might include:</p>
     				<p>English view (1700)
						<ul class="bigbody">
              <li>A wall around the town</li>
              <li>Homes all in one spot lined up as in a plan</li>
              <li>People and animals working in the fields</li>
              <li>Barns</li>
            </ul>
						</p>
     				<p>Pocumtuck view (1550)
						<ul class="bigbody">
              <li>More trails</li>
              <li>Canoes by the river</li>
              <li>Woods being burned for clearing</li>
              <li>A variety of smaller fields of corn hills</li>
              <li>Houses more spread out over the landscape</li>
            </ul>
						</p>
              <p>b. The English built fences to protect what they owned. The Pocumtucks 
                believed that land could not be "owned" because they believed 
                that anyone could use it.</p>
              <p>c. A person might travel from the woods to the river by crossing 
                the English fields, which would involve climbing over their fences 
                or, one might decide to go around the fields, which would take 
                longer. The English would probably have been mad if you crossed 
                their fields. One might tell them &quot;This is the best way to 
                the river and I will try to walk carefully.&quot;</p>
              <p>d. A person might be mad if the English pigs got into their cornfield. 
                They might complain to the English and ask them to keep their 
                animals out of my corn. If the pigs ate a lot of it, they might 
                ask the English to give them some of their corn. Someone else 
                might decide that receiving pay from the English for damage to 
                crops was good enough, but others might decide that more needed 
                to be done such as fencing the pigs in, or killing those that 
                trespassed (which could cause further problems).</p>
              <p>e. The two groups might have lived together in the same spot if 
                they had listened to each other better and both made some compromises, 
                such as penning in livestock, or being willing to walk around 
                fenced fields. Some might believe that the two groups could not 
                have lived easily in the same spot. 
              <p>What really happened was that most of the Pocumtucks left the area to live with other Native peoples. Those who stayed changed their way of life to be more     like the English, so that the English would leave them alone.
