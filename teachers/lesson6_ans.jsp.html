<P CLASS="bigbody">4. Discussion within groups

<P CLASS="bigbody">5. Questions about students' findings:
<blockquote>
              <P CLASS="bigbody">a. The primary sources were written from memory after the fact; 
                none were written at the time of the attack. Some numbers in the 
                primary sources were purposely inflated for political reasons, 
                and the secondary sources were written long after those who experienced 
                the attack were dead. Sometimes people counted differently. For 
                example, there were three Frenchmen living in town. Should they 
                be counted as English captives? (They are.) Sometimes the number 
                of Deerfield residents killed includes only the residents and 
                sometimes it includes other English people in town at the time.</p>

              <P CLASS="bigbody">b. We know less about the numbers of Native Americans killed 
                because they did not keep written records. The French did keep 
                written records.</p>

              <P CLASS="bigbody">c. The later sources might be more reliable since 
                there was time for more research to have been done. The sources 
                that quote people who were alive in 1704 might be more reliable 
                because those people were there. It is interesting to note that 
                only the later sources estimate how many of the enemy combatants 
                were killed, rather than stating exact numbers.</p>              <P CLASS="bigbody">d. Important points - The French and their Native 
                American allies attacked "the most northerly English settlement 
                on the Connecticut River." Although Deerfield residents had received 
                warnings of an attack, it still came as a surprise. A very large 
                number of people were taken captive. While each side saw casualties, 
                the English lost the most people. The French and their allies 
                considered the attack a success.</p>

              <P CLASS="bigbody">It could be said that because the statistics are inconsistent, they should not be included in the important points. But it could also be said that even though the numbers don't agree, they help to illustrate some of the important points, such as showing that the attack was a success.</p>

              <P CLASS="bigbody">e. Conclusions  People should look beyond the 
                numbers to what might be more important; people should look at 
                all the numbers and compare them to see what they reveal as a 
                group; people should not count on any one source as being totally 
                accurate.</p>
