                  c. His plans for the future<br>
                  d. What his education included<br>
                  e. His religious beliefs and the place of religion in his daily 
                  life </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>Once he was captured, what were Stephen's complaints? How was 
                he feeling, both physically and mentally?<br>
              </li>
              <li>Now go to <strong><a href="../scenes/groups.html">Meet the Five 
                Cultures</a></strong> and read about the Wobanakiak. Then click 
                <strong>Learn More About the Wobanakiak</strong>. Start reading 
                at the Ancient Oral Traditions section and read to the end of

                click <strong>Wattanummon</strong> and read about him. Be sure 
                to read the sections Wattanummon's People and Home, Traditions 
                are Passed On, Attack on Deerfield, The March, and Parting Ways. 
                <blockquote> a. Why do you think Wattanummon captured Stephen?<br>
                  b. How did Wattanummon help his captive?<br>
                  c. What skills and strengths was he looking for in Stephen? 
                  Did Stephen seem to have any of them?<br>
                  d. While still in Deerfield, do you think Stephen received as 
                  much farming experience as other boys around him? Do you think 
                  he did as much physical work as they might have done? Why or 
                  why not?<br>
                  e. Do you think Wattanummon should have kept Stephen? Why or 
                  why not? If you were a Wobanaki and Wattanummon had given Stephen 
                  to you, would you have kept him? Why or why not? </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>Now read the Epilogue section of Stephen's life to find out 
                if he stayed with the Wobanakiak or returned home. How do you 
                think his captive experience affected him throughout his life?
