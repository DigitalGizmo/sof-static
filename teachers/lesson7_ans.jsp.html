              <li>
								
                <blockquote> a. Work - Work in fields, care for animals, haul 
                  water and firewood<br>
                  b. Position in Deerfield society - Stephen was from one of the 
                  most prestigious families in Deerfield because his father was 
                  the minister<br>
                  c. Plans - Stephen planned to attend Harvard College and become 
                  a minister<br>
                  d. Education - Lessons at home included reading, writing, and 
                  catechism (once each week by law); he might have attended the 
                  town school. Because he was college-bound, he did not plan to 
                  enter an apprenticeship and did not learn many skills requiring 
                  manual labor.<br>
                  e. Religion - Stephen's people believed in Original Sin and 
                  believed that children were born sinful and must learn to read 
                  for their salvation. The family prayed and read the Bible together 
                  every day and attended four hours of worship services every 
                  Sunday! </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>Stephen's complaints and feelings included: his captors were liars; they murdered children; he was made to travel too far too fast; he had sore and frostbitten feet; he was hungry, frightened, angry, uneasy, and desolate.<br>
              </li>
              <li>A Wobanaki's Life
                <blockquote> a. Work- hunt, fish, forage, care for others<br>
                  b. Education - creation stories of how all creatures came to 
                  be for helping to teach geography and tribal history, stories 
                  as lessons to help correct misbehavior and mistakes<br>
                  c. Values and skills - care for others, guide by example and 
                  encouragement, honor, independent thought, encouraged innate 
                  abilities, wit, handicrafts, personal pride </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>Wattanummon
                <blockquote> a. Wattanummon may have captured Stephen because 
                  as the minister's son, he was more valuable than other captives 
                  in town. Or, Wattanummon might have captured Stephen so he could 
                  give Stephen to someone needing to adopt a son.<br>
                  b. Wattanummon helped Stephen by giving him moccasins, keeping 
                  him from drowning, keeping him from being killed by others, 
                  and showing him how to eat yokeg without choking.<br>
                  c. Wattanummon might have been looking for how much Stephen 
                  knew about hunting, trapping and fishing, or how fast he learned 
                  these skills. Wattanummon was also probably looking for what 
                  survival skills (such as strength, will, sense of direction) 
                  Stephen may have had. Although he was young and strong, Stephen 
                  did not seem to have many survival skills, nor know much about 
                  hunting, trapping and fishing, although he did learn a bit about 
                  tracking animals. He was clumsy in the woods.<br>
                  d. Stephen probably did not do as much in the way of farming 
                  and manual labor as other boys in Deerfield because he was being 
                  groomed for the ministry.<br>
                  e. One reason for Wattanummon keeping Stephen was that Stephen 
                  was worth ransom money, if nothing else. A reason for not keeping 
                  Stephen was that  he did not seem to have the skills 
                  needed to survive in the woods and thus might not have made 
                  a very useful tribal member. </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>After Stephen returned home, he may have felt very thankful for being able to come back to a life with which he was more comfortable; he may have paid much closer attention to the plight of other captives still in Canada; his religious convictions might have been strengthened by his captive experience; his knowledge of life in Canada with both Native people and the French may have been useful to others.
