								    <p class="bigbody">Housing:<br>
                    a. The structure is made of wooden poles and bark.<br>
                    b. They harvested the wood from the surrounding landscape.<br>
                    c. Land was cleared; trees were cut down.<br>
                    d.Once the house is gone, probably nothing will remain and 
                    the site will eventually be covered with trees again. It is 
                    interesting to note that although nothing would be visible 
                    above ground, archeologists can tell where underground storage 
                    pits, post-holes, refuse and fire pits were. </p>
                    <p class="bigbody">Land Use:<br>
                    a. Land use includes growing crops, burning woods for clearing 
                    land and encouraging new growth, traveling on the river, building 
                    homes, creating trails, hunting, fishing and foraging.<br>
                    b. The land has been altered by clearing the woods and cutting 
                    down trees, building homes, creating trails, and planting 
                    crops.<br>
                    c. These people do not stay in one location year-round. They 
                    travel seasonally to fish, garden and hunt, setting up temporary 
                    homes in different areas.<br>
                    d.The Wobanakiak believed that the land, humans, and other 
                    animals were part of the same spirit. They believed that all 
                    beings had a close relationship with this spirit. Because 
                    of this, they thought that all living things (including plants 
                    and animals) should cooperate and share their resources. In 
                    their decisions about the land and work upon it, they kept 
                    their communal relationship in mind and treated non-humans 
                    with the respect due to relatives and ancestors. </p>

                  homes, plenty of woods for hunting, and ,lumber for construction 
                  and firewood.<br>
                  b. The homes are not all located in the same area. </blockquote>

                  <blockquote>
								    <p class="bigbody">Housing:<br>
                    a. The structure is made of wood, glass, metal, stone, and 
                    brick.<br>
                    b. These people harvested the wood and stone from the surrounding 
                    landscape, imported the glass, made the bricks, and made the 
                    metal parts.<br>
                    c. Land was cleared, trees were cut down, a sawmill was built 
                    to make boards, a dam was made for the sawmill, and a cellar 
                    hole was dug.<br>
                    d. Once the house is gone, the cellar hole will remain and 
                    sections of the foundation and chimney. There might be bits 
                    of metal and glass in the soil. Archeologists would be able 
                    to find evidence of where chimneys and cellar holes were and 
                    pieces of glass, metal, ceramics, etc. underground as well. 
                  </p>
                    <p class="bigbody">Land Use:<br>
                    a. Land use includes growing crops, building homes, creating 
                    roads, establishing fields for animals, and constructing fences.<br>
                    b. The land has been altered by clearing the woods and cutting 
                    down trees,building homes, creating roads, planting crops, 
                    and fencing.<br>
                    c. These people stay in one location year-round. Most of what 
                    they need is in one spot; they dont rely heavily upon hunting, 
                    and it is safer to stay put.<br>
                    d. The English believed that vacant, unused land was free 
                    for anyone to use and it was their God-given duty to improve 
                    it. They did not often see the ways in which Native peoples 
                    were using the land or improving upon it, and thus saw nothing 
                    wrong with claiming for Great Britain, land that appeared 
                    to be vacant. Improvement included building homes and roads 
                    and establishing fields and pastures. Because they believed 
                    in individual ownership of land, they built fences. </p>

              <li>The English and Pocumtuck probably would not have gotten along well living in the same area because the Pocumtuck liked to periodically change the locations of their homes and fields. They also wanted to travel across the land whenever and wherever they chose. They English did not want people trespassing on what they thought was their land. They also did not want the Pocumtuck to build homes or establish gardens on what they considered to be English land. The English did not understand Pocumtuck beliefs nor their way of life.

                <blockquote> a. Chauk sold the land to John Pynchon, Eleazer Lusher 
                  and Daniel Fisher.<br>
                  b. Chauk and his people reserved the rights to continue to fish, 
                  hunt and gather nuts.<br>
                  c. The English would defend their new land &quot;from any molestation 
                  or Incumbrance from Indians otherwise than as before reserved.&quot; 
                </blockquote>
							</li>
              <li>The Pocumtuck probably thought that they were sharing the land with the English. They may not have understood that by selling the land, the English would exclusively own and control its use. Chauk might not have understood that only he and his people were awarded hunting, gathering and fishing rights.  Other Native people traveling through the area might not have this right.
							</li>
              <li>The English probably wanted to control Native use of their land. They were willing to let Chauk and his people use the land but not others, whom they didn't know, and they didnt want to encourage Native use of what they thought was their land.
							</li>
              <li>The problems were that Chauk might not have been authorized by his people to act alone, and he might not have meant to sell the land; he might have thought he was granting land-use rights, not ownership.
							</li>
              <li>The English constructed fences. This made it harder for the Pocumtuck to travel freely wherever they wished. The English kept livestock and although they fenced them out of certain areas, they did not fence them in. This meant the livestock were free to roam and could have access to Pocumtuck crops. The Pocumtuck spread their homes across the landscape and changed their location once every few years. The English did not do this and did not want the Pocumtuck on their land. Overall, with the English constructing permanent buildings, fences and roads, the Pocumtuck's access to game was greatly limited.
