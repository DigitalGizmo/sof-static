The order, by virtue of its Montr&eacute;al property                     holdings, exercised considerable influence socially and politically                     in New France.</p>                </td>                <td>                   <p class="subhead">Sacred Music</p>                  <p class="bigbody">In 17th and early 18th century France—and                     thus New France, there was a constancy of debate on issues                     related to morality and theology. The Catholic Counter-Reformation                     had a profound and decisive influence on spiritual and ethical                     behavior. Theological inquiry and religious affairs in New                     France were channeled through a variety of institutions such                     as those established over time by religious orders—most notably,                     Ursuline, Augustinian, Sulpician, and Jesuit. A Jesuit college                     was built within the precincts of Quebec City in 1635, a year                     before the founding, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, of Harvard                     College.</p>                  <p class="bigbody">Music helped to frame religious observances of all sorts. Convent and seminary libraries 									and archives bear testimony to the richness of sacred music heard in New France. Antiphons, masses, and 									motets were regularly heard, composed by musicians such as Andr&eacute; Campra, Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers, 									Nicolas Bernier, and Nicolas-Antoine Leb&egrave;gue—all associated with the court chapel at Versailles, and/or, 									the principal churches of Paris.</p>                  <p class="bigbody">Mechanical action, or "tracker," pipe organs,                     and volumes of printed organ music were regularly exported                     to New France, and noteworthy instruments were set up at an                     early date in Quebec City and Montr&eacute;al. By 1724, a grand organ                     was in place in the Church of Notre-Dame (Our Lady) in Montr&eacute;al;                     this organ was considered important enough that a French cleric and musician, based on reports from New France, sought to fulfill the position. The cleric, Jean Girard (1696-1765), originally                     from the provincial city of Bourges and later trained by Sulpicians                     in Paris, and it is now believed, by Cl&eacute;rambault as well, left for New France and brought along, in addition                     to his other possessions, printed organ music by Nivers, an                     organist to the King and of the parish church of St. Sulpice                     in Paris, and a specially prepared manuscript volume of organ                     music. This particular volume, thankfully preserved over the                     intervening centuries, was rediscovered in 1978 by the Canadian                     musicologist,  &Eacute;lisabeth Gallat-Morin, and is known today as                     the <em>Livre d'orgue de Montr&eacute;al</em>. Although no composer                     names are recorded in the 540-page manuscript, Mme. Gallat-Morin                     and other scholars have been able to identify works by another                     of Louis XIVth's principal organists, Leb&egrave;gue, based on examination                     of printed music and other manuscript transmissions where                     the identity of Leb&egrave;gue is without doubt. The <em>Livre d'orgue                     de Montr&eacute;al</em> is one of the treasures in the permanent                     collection of the Foundation Lionel-Groulx, Montr&eacute;al, a research                     center dedicated to the history of French North America.</p>                  <p>&nbsp;</p>                </td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                <td colspan="2">                   <p class="subhead">Listen to examples of sacred music organ pieces:</p>                  <p class="bigbody"><em><strong>Basse de Trompette</strong></em> <span class="small_menu">(duration:                     1:14 minutes)</span><br>                    Nicolas-Antoine Leb&egrave;gue (ca.1631-1702),<br>                    from the<em> Livre d'orgue de Montr&eacute;al</em>.</p>                  <blockquote>                  <audio controls>  				 <source src="https://1704.deerfield.history.museum/voices/audio/french_music/trompette.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /><BR> 				  <!-- fallback -->      			Your browser does not support the HTML5 audio element; instead you can      			 <a href="https://1704.deerfield.history.museum/voices/audio/french_music/trompette.mp3">download       			 this MP3 audio file.</a> 				</audio>			 <p>MP3 format (file size 1.4MB)</p>                  </blockquote>                  <p class="bigbody">Active in Paris, Leb&egrave;gue was highly regarded                     as a composer, harpsichordist, organist, and organ consultant.                     His expertise in the latter capacity was sought far from Paris                     by church authorities in the cathedral cities of Chartres,                     Soissons, and Bourges, coincidentally, the birth-place of                     Jean Girard, who would become organist of the Church                     of Notre-Dame of Montr&eacute;al and, it is now thought, the first professional musician active in the city.

During                     the reign of Louis the XIVth, he served as organist at Saint                     Sulpice in Paris, Master of Music to the Queen, and Director                     of Music at the Maison Royale de St. Louis, a convent school                     for young women of noble birth.

The music is taken from a variety of known 									sources including works by Andr&eacute; Campra and Henry Du Mont (1610-1684). The sacred text of Haec dies 									drawn from Psalm 117 and is associated with liturgical rites that celebrate the feast-day of Easter.</p>                  <p class="bigbody">The religious orders established in New France fulfilled a significant role in the life of 									  the populace. The institutional church was not only the conduit for spiritual well-being, but also served as a 									  place to convey the protocols and proclamations of the Governor, or Intendant, to those members of the general 									  society who were illiterate. These protocols and proclamations were delivered following parish masses, by and 									  large considered compulsory.</p>                  <p class="bigbody">Another practice of the religious orders from                     the earliest years of French settlement was the conversion                     of the Native peoples. Music was of significant importance                     in the rituals and ceremonies of the Native peoples. Accordingly,                     teaching, or evangelizing, clerics recognized the value of                     music as a practical and useful medium for conversion. Among                     the rarest surviving musical documents from New France is                     the 600-page liturgical manuscript of the Abenaki Mission                     of Saint Francis de Sales, transcribed by a Jesuit cleric,                     Joseph Aub&eacute;ry, (1674-1756) before 1750. The manuscript unites French music,                     in which the liturgical Latin text has been retained, replaced entirely, or in                     part, with a text in Abenaki.</p>                  <blockquote>                  <audio controls>  				 <source src="https://1704.deerfield.history.museum/voices/audio/french_music/motet.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /><BR> 				  <!-- fallback -->      			Your browser does not support the HTML5 audio element; instead you can      			 <a href="https://1704.deerfield.history.museum/voices/audio/french_music/motet.mp3">download       			 this MP3 audio file.</a> 				</audio>			 <p>MP3 format (file size 1.7MB)</p>	               <p class="bigbody">   <A HREF="javascript:MM_openBrWindow('transcripts/motet_text.html','transcript','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=700,height=400')">Latin text and English translation of Haec dies</a></p>                  </blockquote>                </td>              </tr>                            <tr valign="top">                <td colspan="2">                  <P class="subhead">&nbsp;</p>                  <P class="subhead">Credits</p>                  <P class="bigbody">Content and musical selections for Secular French Music of the 17th and early 18th centuries were provided                     by the Practitioners of Musick, an ensemble founded by Messrs.                     John Burkhalter and Eugene Roan to survey the musical riches                     of eighteenth century Great Britain and Ireland, and both                     the colonial and early Federal period in America.
