 tabTexts["Overview"] = '<p><b>Relative peace:</b> In 1636, William Pynchon, founder of <a class="open-link" href="maps/crv/"></a><a class="open-link" href="maps/northeast/">Springfield</a>, Massachusetts, began trading with Native people in the <a class="open-link" href="maps/crv/"></a><a class="open-link" href="maps/crv/">Connecticut River Valley</a>. In the early years of English settlement, Native people\'s willingness to participate in the trade, and the weak position of the English, kept a level of relative peace. By the time John Pynchon took over his father\'s business in 1652, <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Wobanakiak/">W\u00F4banakiak</a>  including the <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Pocumtuck/">Pocumtuck</a>, <a class="open-link" href="glossary/nonotuck/">Nonotuck</a>, <a class="open-link" href="glossary/agawam/">Agawam</a>, <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Woronoco/"></a><a class="open-link" href="glossary/woronoco/">Woronoco</a> and <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Sokwakiak/">Sokoki</a> were trading large amounts of <a class="open-link" href="artifacts/beaverpelt/">beaver furs</a> for English cloth, <a class="open-link" href="artifacts/hatchet/">tools</a>, ready-made clothing and sundries, along with occasional <a class="open-link" href="artifacts/fowler/">guns</a> and ammunition.</p><p><b>Competition and debt:</b> Local traders brought their own furs and also acted as middlemen for their allies. Using European-style account books, the Pynchons allowed Native men and women to receive trade goods in advance of the hunt, with the expectation that accounts would be balanced at the end of the season. As beaver populations declined from over-hunting and European encroachments on wetlands, Native hunters ranged farther afield, increasing competition between <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Algonkian/">Algonkian</a> and <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Iroquoian/">Iroquoian</a> groups. Inter-tribal wars restricted travel and limited access to hunting territories. The credit system that had once been mutually beneficial now entangled Native people in debts they could not repay. Documents listing territorial boundaries that may have served as collateral, were turned into <a class="open-link" href="artifacts/chaukdeed/">deeds</a> in order to clear delinquent accounts. Beaver debts helped the younger Pynchon acquire title to <a class="open-link" href="maps/crv/">parcels</a> of Native homelands that he then resold or rented to settlers. Increased settlement led to increased intercultural conflict.</p><p><b>Temporary refuge: </b><a class="open-link" href="glossary/crv_Indians/">Connecticut River valley Indians</a> built several fortified villages near the English to take advantage of the trade and serve as storehouses. After the <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Kanienkehaka/">Kanienkehaka</a> (Mohawk) attacked their <a class="open-link" href="glossary/fort/">forts</a> in 1663 and 1665, a number of Sokoki and Pocumtuck took temporary refuge at the Nonotuck and Agawam forts. Some <a class="open-link" href="background/expWob_persistence/">moved north</a> to <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Cowass/">Cowass</a>, <a class="open-link" href="glossary/missisquoi /">Missisquoi</a>, or <a class="open-link" href="glossary/St_Francis/"></a><a class="open-link" href="glossary/Odanak/">Odanak</a> (<a class="open-link" href="maps/northeast/">St. Francis</a>).  Several Pocumtuck, including <a class="open-link" href="people/Chauk/">Chauk</a> and Mettawampe signed deeds which reserved rights to continue hunting, fishing, and setting up homes on lands that were supposedly \u0022sold\u0022 to the English.</p><br>';
  tabTexts["English"] = '<p><b>Land deals:</b> The <a class="open-link" href="glossary/French/">French</a> and <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Dutch/">Dutch</a> entered the North American continent <a class="open-link" href="background/expColonialFrench/">primarily to trade</a> and expected their colonies to grow up around trading posts. The <a class="open-link" href="glossary/English/">English</a>, in contrast, <a class="open-link" href="background/expColonialEnglish/">sought land</a> to establish farming communities and viewed trade as a useful by-product. Although they traded extensively with Natives, the Pynchons were mainly interested in brokering land deals to settle English towns on the <a class="open-link" href="maps/crv/">Connecticut River</a>.  By English custom, securing written deeds to Indian land would put that land, and the Native peoples who lived there, under the jurisdiction of English law.</p><p><b>Providence:</b> Wide-spread <a class="open-link" href="background/expEpidemics/">disease</a> had decimated the New England Native population and disrupted inter-tribal relationships in the decades before the English arrived. Many of the early English colonists interpreted this as the work of divine Providence clearing the land for \u0022God\'s chosen people.\u0022 They also thought that if land was underused or used by non-Christian, \u0022uncivilized\u0022 people, they had the right to take it. Under prevailing English laws, people could only claim ownership of land that was being cleared, plowed, planted, grazed or built upon or otherwise \u0022improved.\u0022</p><p><b>\u0022Abandoned\u0022:</b> The English first became attuned to the richness of the Pocumtuck homeland in 1638 when the Pocumtuck sold 500 bushels of corn to the starving English living south of <a class="open-link" href="maps/northeast/">Hartford</a>. Thereafter the English colonies competed with each other to buy corn from the Natives upriver. Within months after the 1665 <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Kanienkehaka/">Kanienkehaka</a> attack on the <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Pocumtuck/">Pocumtuck</a><a class="open-link" href="glossary/fort/"></a>&#032;<a class="open-link" href="glossary/fort/">fort</a>, Pynchon hastened to claim Pocumtuck land he perceived as abandoned. He sealed a land deal with speculators from Dedham, an English town whose residents had been displaced by the establishment of a \u0022<a class="open-link" href="glossary/praying_villages/">praying village</a>\u0022 for Christianized <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Nipmuc/">Nipmucs</a> in eastern Massachusetts.  Pynchon maneuvered Wattawaluncksin, son of the Pocumtuck <a class="open-link" href="glossary/sunksqua/">sunksqua</a>&#032;<a class="open-link" href="people/Mashalisk/Springfield"></a><a class="open-link" href="people/Mashalisk/">Mashalisk</a>, into court and into debt to secure one parcel of Pocumtuck land. He convinced a man named <a class="open-link" href="people/Chauk/">Chauk</a> to sign a deed for another parcel, and encouraged Mettawampe, another Pocumtuck leader, to co-sign, with Shattoockquis, a deed for <a class="open-link" href="glossary/quabaug/">Quaboag</a> territory in what is now Brookfield, MA.</p><br>';
  tabTexts["Wobanakiak"] = '<p><b>Trade goods:</b> During the early years of the fur trade, the abundance of corn and beaver gave <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Wobanaki/">W\u00F4banaki</a> traders a distinct advantage. Natives found practical uses for European trade items, and quickly incorporated many goods into gift-giving networks. Such items, while not necessarily better than Native goods, were easy to obtain. Native women traded their corn and furs for English cloth, clothing and peas.  Some Native men became highly successful traders and go-betweens, apparently elevating their personal status with the <a class="open-link" href="glossary/English/">English</a> and rebalancing leadership dynamics within their communities.</p><p><b>Tense relations:</b> The <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Pocumtuck/">Pocumtuck</a> were part of an extensive, ancient trade network with other <a class="open-link" href="maps/home_wob/">W\u00F4banakiak</a>. The trade now included guns, powder and shot from the <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Dutch/">Dutch</a>, <a class="open-link" href="glossary/French/">French</a> goods from the north, and English goods from Pynchon. Increasing competition and shifting alliances led to disputes over hunting rights and intensified conflicts between the W\u00F4banakiak and <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Kanienkehaka/">Kanienkehaka</a> (Mohawk). When the Kanienkehaka attacked the central Pocumtuck <a class="open-link" href="glossary/fort/">fort</a> in 1665, Pocumtuck people relocated, planning to return when hostilities subsided. Some moved to <a class="open-link" href="maps/northeast/">Nonotuck</a>, near the English town of Northampton, where John Pynchon had set up the sachem Chickwalloppe to govern the Nonotuck.  By 1675, local Indians were more than willing to throw off English rule, abandon these forts, and join in <a class="open-link" href="background/expMetacomsWar/">Metacom\'s Rebellion</a>.</p><p><b>Reserving rights:</b> While the English claimed fair purchase, no Native individual had the right to sell communal homelands. Some Natives apparently took advantage of their relationships with Pynchon to claim sole ownership and pay the debts. Even so, in \u0022selling\u0022 the land, <a class="open-link" href="people/Chauk/">Chauk</a>, like many Native people who signed <a class="open-link" href="artifacts/chaukdeed/">deeds</a>, reserved \u0022Liberty of fishing for ye Indians in ye Rivers or waters &amp; free Liberty to hunt deere or other wild creatures &amp; to gather walnuts chestnuts and other nuts.\u0022 Agreements like these reflect a sense of \u0022joint occupancy\u0022 rather than a true \u0022quit-claim.\u0022 Because the wording of the deed clearly stipulates continued use of Pocumtuck land in traditional ways, legal ownership of the land remains in question to this day.</p><br>';
