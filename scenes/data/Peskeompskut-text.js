 tabTexts["Overview"] = '<p><b>Assault:</b> In the pre-dawn stillness of May 19, 1676, 150 English men led by <a class="open-link" href="people/WilliamTurner/Peskeompskut">Captain William Turner</a> entered the Native fishing camp at <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Peskeompskut/">Peskeompskut</a>, beside the falls on the Connecticut River, north of Deerfield. <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Pocumtuck/">Pocumtuck</a>, <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Sokwakiak/">Sokoki</a>, and <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Nipmuc/">Nipmuc</a> women, children and elders had taken refuge here, along with <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Wampanoag/">Wampanoag</a> and <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Narragansett/">Narragansett</a> people who were escaping the fighting in the south. At Turner\'s signal, the English silently surrounded the wigwams and the peaceful dawn exploded into violence. Gunshots, screams, and flames rent the air as the English shot into wigwams and set them afire. Terrified Native people fled through the smoke to the river where many were shot down or drowned. Over 300 Native people and one English soldier died before Native men hunting nearby rushed to the scene and routed the assailants, killing Turner and 36 others in a disorganized retreat.</p><p><b>Metacom\'s War:</b> The assault on Peskeompskut was the first English offensive action against Native peoples in the Connecticut River Valley during <a class="open-link" href="background/expMetacomsWar/">Metacom\'s War</a>. This war was, by proportion, the bloodiest in American history, killing 40% of southern New England\'s Native population (5,000) and 5% of the English (2,500). Native people throughout the region had endured widespread losses from European-based diseases and English encroachments on their homelands. <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Metacom/">Metacom</a>, a Wampanoag leader, rallied an inter-tribal force against English expansion. In 1675, Native attacks in the <a class="open-link" href="maps/crv/">Connecticut River Valley</a> forced the English to abandon both Northfield and Deerfield. But by May of 1676, having successfully repelled Native attacks in Hatfield and Northampton, the English went on the offensive, attacking Peskeompskut and eventually killing Metacom and winning the war.</p><p>What was the legacy of Peskeompskut?</p><br>';
  tabTexts["English"] = '<p><b>Golden opportunity:</b> Thomas Reed, an English captive held at <a class="open-link" href="glossary/St_Francis/">St. Francis</a> and taken to the Native encampment of <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Peskeompskut/">Peskeompskut</a>, escaped and reported to the English large numbers of "old men and women" in the camp, with only 60&mdash;70 fighting men and a state of unpreparedness. <a class="open-link" href="people/WilliamTurner/Peskeompskut">Captain William Turner</a>, responding to colonist demands for an offensive, sensed a golden opportunity for a morale-boosting, easy victory. Assembling more than 150 local volunteers, he determined to strike a blow against the Indians. In addition to killing many Natives, the English destroyed precious food supplies, ammunition and firearms. Despite a chaotic and costly retreat resulting in the death of Captain Turner, the English celebrated the "<a class="open-link" href="glossary/Falls_Fight/">Falls Fight</a>" as a major triumph over "<a class="open-link" href="glossary/King_Philip/">King Philip\'s</a>" warriors.</p><p><b>Bloody Brook:</b> Earlier that year, English in the Connecticut River Valley had grown increasingly fearful and restless. The previous September, a group of warriors led by the Pocumtuck leader, Mettawampe, ambushed a convoy of English militia and teamsters crossing a muddy brook as they transported grain from the abandoned village of Deerfield to Hadley. Grief-stricken colonists buried over 60 bodies in a mass grave and renamed the site <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Bloody_Brook/">Bloody Brook</a>. The constant threat of Native attacks made planting impossible in exposed towns like Hatfield, where warriors had recently stampeded 70 head of cattle.</p><p><b>English victory:</b> Though not the final battle of <a class="open-link" href="background/expMetacomsWar/">Metacom\'s War</a>, the assault on Peskeompskut was a major setback to Native resistance in the Connecticut Valley. Early in the war, the English enlisted individual <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Mohegan/">Mohegan</a>, <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Pequot/">Pequot</a> and other Native warriors to take up arms against Metacom\'s forces, while the <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Iroquois/">Iroquois</a> and <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Mohican/">Mohican</a> pushed <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Metacom/">Metacom</a> east toward English strongholds. Widespread starvation and social disruption caused by losses in Native communities ultimately assured an English victory.</p><br>';
  tabTexts["Wobanakiak"] = '<p><b>Peskeompskut:</b> For generations, <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Peskeompskut/">Peskeompskut</a> had been a gathering place where Native people fished during annual salmon runs. The safety and food it offered families was even more important during this time of war. Here, far from English forces, they felt secure; they posted no scouts. But on this tragic spring dawn, they awoke to screams and gunfire as safety gave way to massacre. English militia overran the camp, pointing guns in wigwams and killing women, children and elders indiscriminately. Terrified survivors ran to the river and were mercilessly shot down; others drowned as <a class="open-link" href="artifacts/canoe/">canoes</a> capsized in the turbulent water, carrying their occupants over the falls to their deaths.</p><p><b>English expansion:</b> In the decades preceding <a class="open-link" href="background/expMetacomsWar/">Metacom\'s War</a>, English settlements grew rapidly, threatening to overrun local Native populations and homelands. Starvation, forced compliance with foreign colonial laws, territorial disputes and the confusion of English deeds ignited smoldering resentment in southeastern Massachusetts. Hostility spread to the <a class="open-link" href="maps/crv/">Connecticut River Valley</a> as warriors attacked English settlements in an effort to reclaim lost territory and halt expansion. </p><p><b>Devastating blow:</b> The ruthless attack and loss of life at Peskeompskut demoralized <a class="open-link" href="glossary/Metacom/">Metacom\'s</a> allies. It is the only violent attack in either oral or written history on Peskeompskut, a place considered a safe, communal fishing zone by local Native peoples. Their rebuffs at Hatfield and Northampton earlier that spring and the later English resettlement at Deerfield made it clear that the English expansion could not be easily stopped. The devastation at the falls and hillside village at Peskeompskut left lasting wounds among the Native peoples of the Connecticut River Valley. Even future attacks on Deerfield would be insufficient reparations for the loss.</p><br>';
