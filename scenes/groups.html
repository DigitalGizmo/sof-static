            <p class="bigbody">On February 29, 1704, an English settlement situated in Pocumtuck homelands in the mid-Connecticut River valley, became a crossroads for intercultural, interracial, and international conflict. The raid on Deerfield was one incident in an ongoing struggle among Europeans and northeastern Native communities competing for control of Native lands and resources in the colonial northeast. Algonkian and Iroquoian peoples; French, English, and Africans; soldiers, ministers, farmers and traders; men, women, and children&#8212;all were affected by these conflicts.</p>
            <p class="bigbody">At least five cultural groups were present at the attack in 1704: English, French, Kanienkehaka (Mohawk), Wendat (Huron) and W&ocirc;banaki (Abenaki, Pennacook, Sokoki, Pocumtuck and others).</p>

English settlers, however, viewed these lands as a vacant wilderness to be possessed and subdued. The seemingly insatiable English desire for new lands where they could farm, raise families, and create an ideal Protestant society, generated conflict between these newcomers and the region's indigenous inhabitants. The land was further contested as imperial wars drove the English to fight the French for possession of the continent's rich resources.<br>

                    By the 1650s, this warfare forced the Wendats from their lands;

                    from Woronoco, Nonotuck and Sokoki, who had been forced out 
                    of their homelands in the middle Connecticut River valley.
