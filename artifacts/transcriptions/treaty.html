      <P>Copy of the Peace treaty<BR>
      Montr&eacute;al, August 4, 1701</P>
      <P>Ratification of the Peace 
        concluded Last September [1700], between The Colony of 
        Canada, The Savages Its allies, and the iroquois in a 
        general assembly of the chiefs of each of these nations 
        Convened by monsieur the Chevalier de Callieres 
        governor and Lieutenant general for the King in 
        new france.</P>
      <P>In Montreal, the fourth august 1701 
        Given that Last Year there were here only 
        representatives of the huron and the ottawa when I made peace 
        with the Iroquois for myself and all my allies, I deemed it 
        necessary to send the Sieur de Courtemanche, 
        And the R. F. Anjalran, to all of the other nations my 
        allies that were absent to apprise them of what 
        Had taken place and to invite them to send Chiefs of 
        each with the iroquois prisoners in their possession in order 
        that they all Listen together to my word.</P>
      <P>I am extremely joyous to see here now assembled 
        all of my children, you huron, Sable ottawa, 
        Kiskakon, Sinago ottawa, fork people, 
        Saulteaux, potawatomi, Sauk, stinkards, wild rice people, fox, 
        mascouten, Miami, Illini, amikwa, nipissing, algonkin, 
        Timiskaming, Cree, inland people, Kickapoo, people 
        of the Sault, of the mountain, Abenaki and you iroquois nations 
        and that, having one another remitted your interests 
        in my hands I may allow you all to live In 
        tranquillity; I then hereby ratify today the peace 
        concluded last august, my will being that 
        there Be no more talk of the blows struck during the war, and 
        I seize once more all your tomahawks, and all your 
        other war instruments that I place with my own 
        in a pit so deep that no one may 
        take them back, to trouble the tranquillity that I am restoring 
        between my Children, recommending when you 
        meet that you treat each other Like brothers and that you 
        accommodate one another in matters of hunting, in order 
        that there be no Quarrel between you, and so that this 
        peace will not be troubled, I repeat what I have already Said 
        in the treaty that we have concluded, that should 
        one of my children hit another, the one who will have 
        been hit shall not take his revenge, neither himself 
        nor through another, but that he will seek me out so that I may 
        obtain redress, declaring to you that if the party at fault 
        refused to give reasonable Satisfaction, I would join 
        the offended party with my other allies to Compel him to do so, 
        something I doubt could happen, given the obedience 
        owed to me by my children who will remember what it is 
        we are all agreeing to presently and in order 
        that they not forget, I am tying my words to the necklaces that 
        I will be handing to each of your nations so that your 
        elders effect these upon your youth, I 
        invite you all to smoke this peace calumet, which I will do 
        first, and to eat this meat and this broth which 
        I am having prepared for you so that I may have like a good father, 
        the satisfaction of seeing all of my children assembled, 
        I will keep this calumet that was offered to me by the 
        miami so that I may have you smoke 
        when you come to see me,</P>
      <P>after all of the above nations had heard 
        what monsieur le Chevalier de Callieres had to tell them, they 
        responded as Follows,</P>
      <P>The Chief of the Kiskakon 
        I did not want my father knowing that you 
        requested the Iroquois prisoners to fail to bring them to you, 
        so here are four that I would present to you so that you may dispose 
        of them as you see fit. It is with this porcelain that I unbound them 
        and here is a calumet that I offer the iroquois so we may smoke 
        together when we will meet, I am delighted 
        that you have united this land that was disrupted and 
        willingly subscribe to all that you have done.</P>
      <P>The Iroquois<BR>
        Here we are assembled our father, as you 
        wished it so, last year you planted a peace tree 
        And you gave it roots and leaves so that we may find 
        refuge, we now hope that everyone hears 
        what you are saying, that no one will touch this tree, for us 
        we assure you, through these four necklaces, that we will follow 
        all that you have arranged, we present to you these two prisoners 
        and we will hand you the others that we have in our possession, We 
        also hope that as the doors Are now open to 
        peace that the rest of our people will be returned to us.</P>
      <P>The huron,<BR>
        Here we are as you requested, we present you with 
        twelve prisoners, of which five want to return with us, as for 
        the Seven others you may dispose of them as you please, we 
        thank You for the peace that you have provided to us and we 
        gladly ratify it,</P>
      <P>Jean le blanc Sable ottawa, 
        I have obeyed you my father as soon as you asked me 
        by returning to you two prisoners of which you are the master 
        when you commanded me to go to war I did so, 
        and now that you defend me to do so, I obey you, I would ask you 
        my father through this necklace that the Iroquois unbind my body 
        that is with them, and that they return them to me (That is to say the people 
        of His nation)</P>
      <P>Sangouessy Sinago ottawa,<BR>
        I did not want to disobey your orders my father though I 
        have no prisoners, However here are a woman and a 
        child that I purchased and that you may dispose of as you see fit 
        and here is a calumet that I give the iroquois so that we may smoke as 
        brothers when we will meet.</P>
      <P>Chichicatalo, Chief of the Miami<BR>

        have brought you more, though I do not see here those 
        of mine that are with the iroquois, I will bring back the 
        rest, should you wish so, or I will open the doors to them so that they 
        may return,</P>

        through this peace, for myself I will never lose this Brightness, </P>
      <P>The Mascouten<BR>

        to embrace the peace that you have concluded between the Iroquois and ourselves, 
        The Saulteaux and the Stinkards
