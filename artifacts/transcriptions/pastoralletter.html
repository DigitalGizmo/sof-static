  INasmuch as I may neither be permitted to return with you ; nor be permitted to come to see you before you
  return ; These come to acquaint you,
  That I am truly desirous of your Prosperity, for Soul and Body. I would
  bless God who is opening a door of Return for you : And if God be your
  Front-Guard, and Rereward, it shall
  yet go well with you ; a Mercy , I
  would humbly be imploring for you.
  I hope you will continue to Pray for
  us that are left behind, that God would<BR>

<P> preserve and recover us, and give us Grace to Glorify his Holy Name, tho' 
  He continue, yea increase our Trials. If we may be Witnesses for God, and Serve 
  him, tho' under fiery Trials, we shall be no losers. The Lord help us by his 
  Grace (<em>for of our selves we are insufficient to do any thing) </em>to keep 
  the Faith, and suffer according to his Will. He has foretold us, <em>that through 
  much Tribulation we must enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</em>. If God will 
  bless ; no matter what men say of us. As for you, I would offer a few words 
  of Counsel to you in your Voyage. What is it that is most upon your heart in 
  your Return ? Is it that you may with all Freedom Glorify God,<em> in bringing 
  forth much Fruit, whereby He may be Glorifyed</em>, whilst you are again planted 
  in the <em>Court-yards of our God</em> ? How sorrowful is it, if your greatest 
  design be to see your Friends so long separated from you ; to Gain Estates, 
  and recover your outward Losses ; and to be free again to go and come as you 
  lift ! When you return, consult, <em>Luk</em>.8.39. and see from thence, that 
  it well becomes them who <br>

<P> had Eminent Mercies, to be shewing to others<em> what great Things God has 
  done for them</em>. Hereby you will be advancing the Glory and Honour of God, 
  the highest, last, and most noble End Man was made for. Hereby you will comply 
  with the Revealed Will of God : For He says, <em>Call upon me in the day of 
  trouble ; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. </em>Hereby you will 
  also stir up others to Glorify God on your behalf. Hereby also you may gain 
  good Counsels, Directions, &amp; the Prayers of many in order to your improving 
  such Mercies, so as God may have Glory, &amp; your Souls a continued profiting. 
  Yea, hereby you may be instrumental in putting others upon trusting God, &amp; 
  making Him their Refuge in an Evil day. Let God have the Glory of preserving 
  you ; and don't ascribe it to your own Wisdom, or Goodness ; don't think to 
  go sharers or partners with God in his Glory : He has done it for the Honour 
  of his Name. Read <em>Psal.</em> 66.13, 14. and learn from thence, that a truly 
  gracious Soul delivered out of Afflictions, will be very careful to fulfil his 
  promises, and pay his Vows made<BR>
  to

<P>Mr. John Williams</P>
<P> to God in the day of his distress. For otherwise you will unavoidably fall 
  into the number of them spoken of, <em>Psal</em>. 78. 34, 35, 36, 37. Without 
  this, you will fail of a comfortable Evidence, that your Deliverance is in special 
  Mercy. It's certain, <em>That he who Glorifies God, is one that orders his Conversation 
  aright</em>. Be careful to perform your Promises as to the matter, manner, time, 
  and end of Obedience : Be thorough in your Obedience. The performing your Promises 
  will turn to your own special and peculiar gain and profit. Surely, God has 
  a worse Prison, than any of you have yet been in, for them that will not honestly 
  pay their Debts of Obedience to Him,<em> Eccl</em>. 5. 4. &amp;c. Consider how 
  angry God was with <em>Hezekiah, for not</em> <em>rendering to the Lord according 
  to the Mercy bestowed upon him,</em> 2 <em>Chron</em>. 32. 25. God manifested 
  his Displeasure in very signal Works of Judgment upon<em> Israel</em> in the 
  Wilderness for their Unthankfulness to God for his great Mercy in bringing them 
  from Egypt ; yea, destroyed many of them in the Wilderness. You will have ma-</P>

<span class="bigbody">( Page 10 )</span>
<P>10</P>
<P>A Pastoral Letter of</P>
<P> ny Temptations from within, and from without, to be neglecting your Duties 
  of Obedience. You have the World as it were, to begin again. Well, Consider 
  the greatest Concernment is to make sure of an incorruptible Inheritance, <em>an 
  House not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens.</em> We are here, at longest, 
  but only Sojourners. If you turn again to Folly, God will be very angry, <em>Jer</em>. 
  2. 20. <em>&amp;c</em>. Surely, a provoking God to Anger, is not the way to 
  thrive, for Soul or Body. Yea, neglect of Duty, will give great ground to fear 
  that the Furnace has not been sanctified to your purging and purifying. Peace 
  and Friendship with God, is the best Peace and Friendship. Sincere Souls have 
  it much upon their hearts how they shall walk answerable to the expectations 
  of God from them for the Mercies they receive at his Hands, <em>Psal</em>. 116. 
  12. They are careful that their Thoughts, Desires, Delights, Choice, Refusals, 
  Words and Actions be such as may be for Gods Glory, and Honour. They are therefore 
  very watchful against every thing that would draw a-<br>
way</P>

   way their hearts from God ; or prevent
  and hinder their living holily. Yea,
  all that have gained Spiritual benefit
  by Afflictions, are much in bewailing
  their unsuitable behaviour under Afflictions. Oh, it's a matter of shame to
  think how much they pored upon their
  Afflictions, and how little on their Sins
  that procured all their Afflictions ; that
  they were so impatient under Afflictions ; so much concerned to get Afflictions removed ; and so little concerned
  to carry graciously under them, to profit by them, to get them sanctified to
  them : Yea, that they have been so
  very Unbelieving, and full of carking
  cares under them, and so backward to
  a committing all to God's Disposal ;
  that they have been so full of guile and
  deceit, and unbroken in spirit in all
  their Acknowledgments, and Confessions of Sin ; so little of a gracious Prayerfulness : Yea, that there is so much
  opposition in their Will to the Will of
  God in disposing and governing the
  Affairs of the World according to the
  Counsel of his own Will : Yea, that
  they have in so great a degree been<BR>
  forgetful

<P>forgetful of God, whilst they have been inordinately afraid of man. They bewail 
  that they were so very unthankful for what Mercies they had continued to them, 
  and that they did no more improve them for God and his Glory. Whilst others 
  bewail that they have been so long under Afflictions ; do you bewail that you 
  carried no better under them. If God in special Mercy be leading you forth ; 
  I am sure, he is leading you out in penitential Weeping and Supplications. If 
  you come forth as Gold well refined ; cleansed from all your Filthiness, and 
  saved from all your Idols : What a Mercy do you Enjoy ! The best Freedom, is 
  Freedom by Jesus Christ from Spiritual Evils. Sirs, the Expectations of God, 
  and Man too, will be great from you. Oh ! let it be made evident that you were 
  brought into Captivity for your Good. Oh ! improve Gospel Priviledges with all 
  Fidelity. Don't begrudge God time for Religious Services. Don't content yourselves 
  in being <em>Hearers</em> ; but be you <em>Doers</em> of the Word. Let your 
  Thankfulness be expressed in a continued, uni-<br>
  versal,</P>

<P>versal, holy Conversation. Watch against all Appearances of Evil ; and all
  leading Causes to a Forgetting God, or
  ill requiting of Him for all his Kindness
  to you. Don't think after your Return ;
  that, having desired Publickly in the
  Congregations of God's People to have
  Thanks returned to God on your behalf ;
  you have done your Duty. This is the
  way to be like them that <em>Sang his Praises,</em>
  <em>but soon forgot his wondrous Works</em>. Thanksliving is the best Thanksgiving. Oh !
  that all your Souls may flourish in exemplary Holiness and Piety, when you
  are again setled in God's Sanctuaries. Let
  God's Sabbaths be duely, at all times,
  Sanctified. If any of you are yet in an
  Unconverted State ; let not your outward freedom put away the sense of the
  Deplorableness and Dangerousness of an
  Unconverted State ; and of the Depths
  of Misery they are in, that are Captives
  to Sin and Satan, and Condemned already by a Holy God, for not believing
  on the Name of the Son of God. Oh !
  make all Haste to get into a Converted
  State. Christ seems to be Saying to you.

<P><em>upon you.</em> Improve all Helps for a thorough, and Well-wrought Conversion 
  to God. Incline your ears to hear, and hearken diligently to the glad Tidings 
  of Salvation by Jesus Christ. If God has Sanctified to any of you your outward 
  Captivity, to a purging away your Sins, and to a making you partakers of his 
  Holiness : Say with Psalmist,<em> that it is good for you, that you have been 
  Afflicted</em> ; yea, that in Faithfulness He has caused you to be Afflicted. 
  And at your Return, be you found among them that fit under Christ's Shadow with 
  great Delight ; and let his Fruit be sweet to your taste. Draw nigh to Him in 
  all his holy Institutions, that your Souls may be filled with the <em>Fulness 
  of Him who filleth all in all</em>. Let your Souls follow hard after the Lord, 
  and the desire of your Souls be to the Remembrance of his Name. As to them of 
  you who were through Christ reconciled to God, before your Captivity ; let it 
  be evident that you have been purged to bring forth more fruit ; <em>Job</em>. 
  15. 2. If you lose your Dross, I know you will [ yet ] bless God, tho' He has 
  exercised you with<br>

<P>many Afflictions and Temptations, and heat the Furnace to a high degree. For 
  it is, <em>if need be</em>, that we are in heaviness through manifold Temptations. 
  The unfruitful Tree is Unpruned, and reserved for the Fire ; when the choicest 
  Fruit-bearing Tree is pruned in a great degree. Our heavenly Father knows best 
  what is best for us ; and in what way to lead us through a Vale of Tears, to 
  his Glory. The Experience of Saints in all Ages, proves that a long time of 
  outward Prosperity has been more hurtful to the Children of God, as to the concerns 
  of their Souls ; than manifold trying Afflictions for a long time. God has always 
  a Father's Love to his Own ; yea, even then, when He has his Rod in his hand, 
  or be chastning with it : for He always aims at our Profit. The Rod and Reproof 
  give Wisdom. Well, see to it after your Return, that you be more lively, more 
  exemplary, more self-denying, more tender, more holy in all your Conversation, 
  than before. Be entirely devoted to the glorifying of God. If any of you labour 
  under spiritual Darkness, and be buffeted with Temptations ;<BR>

  ; Be advising with the Word of God for Light, and Direction ; Be acting and 
  Exercising the Faith of <em>Dependence </em>on God, when you hant a Faith of 
  <em>Assurance ; Isa</em>. 50. 10. Use all Helps appointed by God for your Establishment. 
  Oh ! Grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 
  Oh ! Endeavour to stir up all you converse with, thoroughly to amend their Ways 
  and Doings ; Whilest in all Holiness of Conversation you have your Walk among 
  them. Tell others, how great a Privilege they enjoy, that have the Scriptures, 
  and so many Days in God's Courts. And at your Return, beware lest you forget 
  your own judgment, whilest in Captivity, of the Preciousness of such a choice 
  Mercy. Oh ! be found daily, and with all Fervour of Soul, in your Closets, pouring 
  out your Souls before God. And Pray for <em>us</em>, that are so dull and slow 
  of heart to do our Duty ; and are therefore kept under the Rod. Oh ! for the 
  effectual pouring out of the Spirit from on high<br>

<P>upon you that go, and upon us that
  stay here : Without which neither you
  nor we shall behave ourselves as becomes
  the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We have
  great Encouragement to be Praying for
  the Spirit : for our glorious Redeemer,
  whilst here, told us how acceptable it
  would be, to be importunately Crying to
  God for it ; and how ready and willing
  He was to give the Spirit to them that
  ask.</P>
<P>When you return, doubtless you will find many Temptations, as well as Helps 
  ; you had need therefore be daily upon your Watch. Don't forget the way God 
  has led you in, to humble and prove you ; that you might know what was in your 
  hearts. Spiritual Idolatry, which is<em> Covetousness,</em> is highly displeasing 
  to God. Having seen the Vanity and Transitoriness of <em>Earthly </em>Comforts 
  ; let your Conversation for the future, be more in <em>Heaven</em>. You will 
  daily need to be in the exercise of Faith for a Conquest over the World. Let 
  us look after those things that are Unseen, that are Eternal. Whilst others 
  cry, <em>Give, give</em>, as to the World ; let our Cry be<br>
  for</P>

<P>for Grace and Spiritual Blessings. The Light of God's Countenance on the Soul, 
  will give more Joy ; than the time wherein Corn, Wine and Oyl have been much 
  increased. <em>Seek first the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness, and all 
  these things shall be added unto you. Lay not up for your selves treasures upon 
  Earth, where Moth and Rust doth corrupt, &amp; where Thieves break through and 
  steal : but lay up for your selves Treasures in Heaven, where neither Moth nor 
  Rust do corrupt, and where Thieves do not break through and steal : for where 
  your </em>Treasure<em> is, there will your </em>Heart<em> be also.</em></P>
<P>I have written more largely here, because I know, your Temptations ( having 
  the World to begin again ) will arise much from thoughts what to Eat, and what 
  to Drink, and wherewith to be Cloathed ; having lost your Earthly Comforts. 
  And our great Danger often lyes in our cravings of, and seeking after <em>Lawful</em> 
  Comforts. Inordinancy of Desire after Lawful things, will put a stop to a lively 
  exercise of Grace. Being forewarned, labour to be forearmed. I hope God will 
  supply all your<br>
Wants

<P>Wants for Soul and Body too. By the Grace of God, my Fellow-Sufferers shall 
  always be upon my heart, when I am before God. I wish you a healthy, a safe, 
  a speedy Passage to your Desired Port ; if it be the Will of God. But above 
  all, I wish you a gracious, truly Penitent, Christ-prizing and Soul-enriching, 
  sanctifying Voyage to a better Port ; when it is the pleasure of God to call 
  you to come Home to your Fathers House ; <em>Even that House not made with Hands, 
  Eternal in the Heavens.</em> There is an incorruptible Inheritance ; there is 
  perfect Holiness ; There is a perfect, uninterrupted Enjoyment of God ; a seeing 
  of Him in a glorious manner. Oh ! let CHRIST JESUS, who is the Best Friend, 
  be secured and prized by us ; for he is a never-dying Friend. As for many other 
  Friends, and dear Relations, who were ready to serve us under our Trials ; we 
  shall never more see them, or meet with them in this World : But comfortable 
  grounds of Hope of meeting with them in a better World, should bear up our hearts

  us all approve our selves in all sincerity of Heart and Life, the Willing Subjects

  Well ! I commit you all to His Keeping Care, and Conduct ; intreating you would 
  take in good part these few general Truths, and Words of Counsel, that, with 
  a heart full of Affection to you, I have hastily drawn up, and sent as the only 
  way I have, at present, to have any Converse with you. If they may be of any 
  Service, let God have the Glory. And I intreat your united Prayers to God for 
  us left behind, whilst you are together : and afterwards, the Continuance of 
  your Prayers ; that we may be left to do nothing dishonourable to God, scandalous 
  to Religion, or prejudicial to our own Souls ; that we may not give occasion 
  to the Adversary to reproach, or speak evil of the Right Wayes of GOD.</P>
