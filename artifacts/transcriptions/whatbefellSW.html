      <P>What befell Stephen Williams<BR>
        in his captivity.<BR>
        On the last of February 1703/4 <BR>
        the French and indians came &amp;sur-<BR>
        prized our fort &amp; took it, and after <BR>
        they had broken into our house &amp; took <BR>
        us prisoners, they Barbariously murdered a <BR>
        Brother &amp;<BR>
        Sister of mine, as they did se-<BR>
        veral of our neighbours. They rifled<BR>
        our house &amp; then marched away with <BR>
        us that were captives, and set our house<BR>
&amp; barn afire, as they did ye greatest <BR>
        part of ye town. when ye greatest <BR>
        part of ye Enemy were gone out of town <BR>
        there come some English from ye next <BR>
        town yt drove those indians yt remained <BR>
        in ye town away, but they were quick<BR>
        -ly driven back again by the rest of ye <BR>
        Army, 9 of ym were slain as they retreated.<BR>
        then they marched a little further<BR>
        stoped for they had several wounded men <BR>
        that hindered them. there they tould us yt <BR>
        if the English persued ym they would <BR>
        kill us, but if otherwyse they<BR>
        would not. but they quickly proved ymselves <BR>
        Lyars for before they departed from yt place <BR>
        yy barbariously murdered a child of about two</P>
      <P>(Page 2)</P>
      <P>two years old. there my master took <BR>
        away my English shoes and gave me<BR>
        indian ones in ye room of ym wch I think <BR>
        were better to travail in. then we march<BR>
        -ed 5 or 6 miles further were we took up <BR>
        our Lodging. Then one English man run <BR>
        back to Deerf: which provoked ym much: <BR>
        they told us if any more ran away they <BR>
        would burn ye rest. there they slew <BR>
        our negro man. they next morning <BR>
        we travailed about 2 or 3 miles they <BR>
        murdered my ever honored Mother who <BR>
        having gone over smal river which <BR>
        water runing very swift flung her <BR>
        down She being wet was not able to <BR>
        travail any further. We travailed 8<BR>
        or 9 mile further &amp; Lodged yt night.<BR>
        there were some disturbed for some had five or six <BR>
        captives &amp; others none. then they called <BR>
        ye captives together to make a more E-<BR>
        qual distribution. but I remained wth my <BR>
        former master. here they searched me <BR>
        And took away my silver buttons &amp; <BR>
        buckels wch I had on my shirt. Before we <BR>
        came to a small river named ye westriver <BR>
        about thirty miles above Deerf: <BR>
        they murdered 3 or 4 more persons. Wn they came <BR>
        to ye west river where they had slays &amp;<BR>
        Dogs wth which they drew there wounded <BR>
        men they travailed. (we thought as if<BR>
        they delighted to kill us all, to eyly traval-<BR>
        ed 35 or 40 miles aday.</P>
      <P>(Page 3)</P>
      <P>there they killed near a duozen of <BR>
        women &amp; children, for there manner <BR>
        was if any Loitered to kill ym. my<BR>
        feet were very sore so yt I was afraid-<BR>
        they would kill me also. we rested on <BR>
        the Sabbath day. they gave my father Li-<BR>
        berty to preach. there we sang a psalm <BR>
        for they required of us a song. ye next <BR>
        day we travailed a great way far-<BR>
        ther yn we had at any time before. <BR>
        about the middle of the day some yt were <BR>
        in ye rere fired at some Geese yt flew <BR>
        over wch put-- ym into a considerable <BR>
        fright, for ye thought yly English <BR>
        were come up wth ym. then began to <BR>
        bind the prisoners and to prepare ymselves <BR>
        for battle, but wn they understood wt ye <BR>
        matter was they shot a volley for joy<BR>
        boasting yt ye English could not over-<BR>
        take ym. I coming to my Hon: Father <BR>
        he told me he was taken Lame in <BR>
        his Ankel wch he sprained in ye fall of ye <BR>
        year, he said likewise he thought he should <BR>
        be killed, &amp; if I should Live to get to <BR>
        Canada to tell ym who I was &amp;c., wch then <BR>
        did terrifie me much, but it pleased y<BR>
        to strenthen him to perform his journey. <BR>
        the next day was a tempestuous day <BR>
&amp; I froze my great toe of my left <BR>
        foot. the day after wch was Wednesday my <BR>
        master bid me go down to ye river wth <BR>
        him (very early in ye morning) wch startled <BR>
        me for he did not use to be so early. there ye <BR>
        river parted.</P>
      <P>(Page 4)</P>
      <P>&amp; I went up one branch, my father wth <BR>
        my brs. &amp; sisters the other. I never saw my <BR>
        father for 14 months after. I did not <BR>
        eat anything in ye morning yet must <BR>
        travail all day, yes I travailed till a-<BR>
        bout 9 o&#8217;clock at night wth out one mor-<BR>
        -sel of victuals. I travailed about 50 <BR>
        miles yt day &amp; night. for my supper I had one <BR>
        spoonfull of indian corn; in ye morning <BR>
        5 or 6 cornels, but must travail. then <BR>
        we left the river and travailed till about <BR>
        noon on ye west side of ye river and yn <BR>
        we came to two wigwams, where were sighns of<BR>
        indians but no indians. (in these wigwams <BR>
        they left yr packs and went ahunting if <BR>
        perhaps yy might find some mouse bu<BR>
        ried in ye snow by ye hunting indians, but <BR>
        could not find any. I wandered about &amp; <BR>
        lost myself &amp; Hollowed, my master <BR>
        come to me &amp; was very angry wth me <BR>
        threatened to kill me, he lift up the breach <BR>
        of his gun in order thereto, but God keept <BR>
        back his hand, for wh I desire his name <BR>
        might be praised. ye indians will never al-<BR>
        Low abody to Hollow in ye woods. yr man<BR>
        -ner is to make a noise Like wolves or any <BR>
        other wild creatures, when they would <BR>
        call to one another, my master sent <BR>
        ye indian lad &amp; I to those wigwams but <BR>
        he himself took his gun &amp; went out a hunting. <BR>
        (now yr were only we three in company, we had all <BR>
        ye army) we made a fire, but had no vic-<BR>
        tuals to dress, only a mouses paunch wh ye<BR>
        ye hunting indians had left. we took yt pan out <BR>
&amp; boiled wthout cleaning of it for wt was on <BR>
        it served for thickening ye broth. ther we tarried yt night <BR>
        and ye next day till about noon, then</P>
      <P>(Page 5)</P>
      <P>there come an indian girl &amp; brought <BR>
        us some mouses meat dryed, wch I <BR>
        thought was ye best victuals ever I eat. <BR>
        we travailed wth yt indian girl about <BR>
        10 miles were was two wigwams. <BR>
        my master yt left us ye day before was got <BR>
        there, whiles we tarried here ye french <BR>
        yt were in ye army passed by. within <BR>
        a day or two we travailed <BR>
        seven or eight miles northward to <BR>
        a place where they had killed some <BR>
        moose; where they made wigwams <BR>
        (for yr manner was when they killd <BR>
        any moose to move to ym &amp; Ly by ym <BR>
        till yy had eaten ym up.) now there <BR>
        was two Englishmen of our town <BR>
        in company wth me, who came up from ye <BR>
        army, to wit Deacon Hoit &amp; one ja-<BR>
        cob Hix, a souldier, (now my mas-<BR>
        ter was not yet come to his own <BR>
        family, from hence he went <BR>
        to Look for his family &amp; within a <BR>
        day or two sent for me. I thought <BR>
        this was hard to go away alone (yt <BR>
        is to any English persons) here I left <BR>
        Deacon Hoit &amp; of H. deacon Hoit I <BR>
        never saw more for he was dead be-<BR>
        fore I came from hunting) I <BR>
        went wth ye mesenger and after a <BR>
        tedious days travail we came to my master <BR>
        family. he gave to me his br. wth whom <BR>
        I continued two or 3 months thereabouts <BR>
        hunting moose, bears, &amp; beavers, (but wn </P>

      <P>I first arrived here they were Ex-<BR>
        -traordinary kind took card of my toe <BR>
        yt was frozen, would not suffer me to <BR>
        any work, gave me a dear skin to Ly on <BR>
&amp; a bears skin to cover me withall, <BR>
        but this did not Last Long, for I <BR>
        was forced to carry such a pack wn <BR>
        I travailed yt I could not rise up <BR>
        with out some help. was forced<BR>
        to cut wood &amp; carry it sometimes a consi-<BR>
        -derable way on my Back. after yt <BR>
        manner I lived till ye hunting <BR>
        time was over, without any society <BR>
        but yes inhuman pagans. yn <BR>
        we travailed with a desighn to go to <BR>
        Cowass, were ye rendezvouze but <BR>
        before we had got quite there we met <BR>
        some indians yt stopt us, they told us yt <BR>
        all ye indians were coming away from <BR>
        Cowass wch within a day or two came to us.<BR>
        now ye reason of there deserting ye Land <BR>
        was this, there came one English man <BR>
        wth six of our indians8 &amp; destroyed a family of indi-<BR>
        ans about 20 mile below <BR>
        Cowass.) here we staid where these in-<BR>
        -dians met us amonth or six weeks, <BR>
        suffered much for want of provision <BR>
        for there was not much to be got a-<BR>
        -hunting then, &amp; if yr was any thing it <BR>
        was as nothing amongst so many. the cheif <BR>
        of our provision was roots of several <BR>
        sorts, &amp; bark of trees. here I met ye a-</P>
      <p class="bigbody">(Page 7)</p>
      <p>bove said jacob Hix. Deacon Hoit was al-<BR>
        -ready dead for want of provision<BR>
        this Hix he Lookt like a ghost, was no<BR>
        thing but skin &amp; bone could scarce<BR>
        go yet had no victualls but w<SUP>t</SUP> <BR>
        he got himself, (for he had been at <BR>
        Cowas with y<SUP>e</SUP> indians aplanting<BR>
        corn; where he suffered much for<BR>
        want of provisions) I was better of<BR>
        it than they, for whiles I was hunt<BR>
        -ing we had meat enough, but<BR>
        neither bread or salt to eat w<SUP>th</SUP> it.<BR>
        there was in company now one M<SUP>rs</SUP> <BR>
        Bradley of Haverhill, &amp; one Hannah<BR>
        eastman, one Daniel Ardery of Ha-<BR>
        -verhill, &amp; one M<SUP>rs </SUP>Jones &amp; Margeret<BR>
        Hugens, her maid, who were taken at<BR>
        Northampton farms.<SUP><BR>
        </SUP>now from hence we set away for<BR>
        Canada, my master had so<BR>
        much Lumber to carry y<SUP>t</SUP> we were<BR>
        forced to carry apack a mile or two <BR>
        and go back &amp; fetch another, w<SUP>ch</SUP> was<BR>
        very tedious, Jacob Hix dyed at y<SUP>e</SUP> <BR>
        first carrying place of y<SUP>e</SUP> french ri-<BR>
        ver; this was an Exceeding tedious march <BR>
        to me we being so Loaden, the other in<BR>
        -dians left us. I suffered much in <BR>
        this journey, for when we came to y<SUP>e</SUP><BR>
        french river it was as much as our<BR>
        canoe would carry our Lumber, y<SUP>e</SUP> wa-<BR>
        -ter was so shallow, so y<SUP>t</SUP> I was forc-<BR>
        -ed to travail afoot on y<SUP>e</SUP> bank w<SUP>th</SUP>-<BR>
        -out any shoes. my feet were much <BR>
        galled and one or two of my toes almost <BR>
      </P>
      <p class="bigbody">(Page 8)</p>
      <p>cut of with y<SUP>e</SUP> stones, I had Little or<BR>
        any thing to eat, my master killed <BR>
        a duck one day in the river &amp; for my <BR>
        part I had y<SUP>e</SUP> guts which I Laid on y<SUP>e</SUP> <BR>
        coals without cleaning y<SUP>m</SUP> which <BR>
        seemed a sweet morsel to me. they did <BR>
        eat skins &amp; c., but w<SUP>n</SUP> we arived at y<SUP>e</SUP> <BR>
        Lake we were supplyed with fish &amp; <BR>
        fowl, for there is a great number <BR>
        both of fish &amp; fowl. The indian boys<BR>
        do kill the Geese with there bows &amp; ar-<BR>
        -rows. they are so bold. fish can be <BR>
        easily taken with hooks, one day as <BR>
        we sayled on y<SUP>e</SUP> Lake two young indi-<BR>
        ans shot a fish with a bullet &amp; <BR>
        took it into y<SUP>e</SUP> canoe, it was as Large <BR>
        as I am. I arrived at Chamble in Au-<BR>
        -gust w<SUP>h</SUP> was about half a year from y<SUP>e</SUP> <BR>
        time I was taken, the french were<BR>
        kind to me, gave bread which I had <BR>
        not eaten in a great while. they told me <BR>
        my Father &amp; brothers &amp; sisters were<BR>
        got to canada which I was glad to <BR>
        hear of for I was afraid my young-<BR>
        -est brother was killed. whiles I tar-<BR>
        -ried here a frenchman came &amp; desired y<SUP>e</SUP> <BR>
        indians to Let me go with him, which <BR>
        they did, I went w<SUP>th</SUP> y<SUP>e</SUP> frenchman who <BR>
        gave me some vituals, &amp; made me <BR>
        Ly down in his couach, which my masters <BR>
        son perceiving told his father who <BR>
        thought he did it to hide me &amp; did de-<BR>
      </P>
      <p class="bigbody">(Page 9)</p>
      <p>sighn to steal me, upon which he <BR>
        came &amp; fetcht me away and would <BR>
        not let me go to the fort any more <BR>
        for which I suffered. (whiles I was <BR>
        here y<SUP>e</SUP> french dressed my feet y<SUP>t</SUP> were wound-<BR>
        -ed at which y<SUP>e</SUP> indians seemed to <BR>
        be vext.) from here we went towards <BR>
        Sorelbut tarried a day or two near at <BR>
        french mans house. about 3 mile <BR>
        from Shamble, who was kind to me <BR>
&amp; would have Lodged me in his house <BR>
        but y<SUP>e</SUP> indians would not allow of <BR>
        it mistrusting he would con<BR>
        -vey me away in y<SUP>e</SUP> night privately<BR>
        from hence we went to Sorrel &amp; <BR>
        as soon as we had Landed there <BR>
        came a woman a crost y<SUP>e</SUP> river on <BR>
        purpose to bring me some victuals &amp; <BR>
        seemed to pity me. here we tarried a <BR>
        day or two. my master bid me go to <BR>
        y<SUP>e</SUP> fort a visiting w<SUP>ch</SUP> was about four-<BR>

        could not comply with y<SUP>r</SUP> rites &amp; cus-<BR>

        here the indians did say something<BR>

        they found I had they were well <BR>
        pleased. my master had a mind to go<BR>

        with him, but because he had sent <BR>
        such word (y<SUP>t</SUP> they must buy by such<BR>
        a time) he left me at home y<SUP>t</SUP> I <BR>
        might be ready if they should send<BR>

        come to Canada my mistris thought<BR>
        there would be an exchange of <BR>
        prisoners, and lest the french <BR>
        should then take me away for no-<BR>
        -thing she removed up in y<SUP>e</SUP> woods a-<BR>
        bout half a mile from y<SUP>e</SUP> river<BR>
        y<SUP>t</SUP> if they came they might not <BR>
        find me; whiles on a certain day <BR>
        my mistris went to a french <BR>
        house to get victuals, and ordered<BR>
        me to spend this day in getting wood, <BR>
        but it proved a tempestuous day<BR>
        and we had half a cart load of <BR>
        wood at y<SUP>e</SUP> door (which is a great deal<BR>
        for indians to have) so y<SUP>t</SUP> I did not get<BR>
        any. when she came home (being <BR>
        disturbed by y<SUP>e</SUP> french) asked<BR>
        w<SUP>t</SUP> I had <BR>

      <p> been adoing, they replyed nothing.<BR>
        at which she was very angry. I<BR>
        will not beat you myself (says she)<BR>
        for my husband ordered me to the con-<BR>
        -trary, but will tell y<SUP>e</SUP> jesuit, y<SUP>e</SUP> <BR>
        next time he comes (now y<SUP>ly</SUP> were <BR>
        not gone so far that y<SUP>e</SUP> jesuit <BR>
        knew were they went, who often vi-<BR>
        -sits y<SUP>m</SUP>) within a day or two, y<SUP>e</SUP> je-<BR>
        -suit comes. She was as good as her <BR>
        word, did complain. he takes me out<BR>
        and whips me with a whip w<SUP>th</SUP> six <BR>
        cords several knots in each cord.<BR>
        after a few days he comes again &amp; <BR>
        brings me a letter from my Father<BR>
        by wich I understood he was a priso-<BR>
        -ner as well as I, which I told y<SUP>e</SUP> in-<BR>
        -dians, who said they believed it. he<BR>
        Likewise said in his letter y<SUP>t</SUP> y<SUP>e</SUP> go-<BR>

        care we should be redeemed.<BR>
        whilst I lived here I made about <BR>
        fourscore weight of sugar w<SUP>th</SUP> y<SUP>e</SUP> <BR>
        sap of maple trees for y<SUP>e</SUP> indians. <BR>
        my mistriss had a mind to go to So-<BR>
        -rel &amp; because y<SUP>r</SUP> was a barrel of sap <BR>
        to boil she sent me to y<SUP>e</SUP> sugar place <BR>
        over night to boil it, y<SUP>t</SUP> so we might <BR>
        go in y<SUP>e</SUP> morning. I went and kept a <BR>
        good fire under y<SUP>e</SUP> kittle. Little think<BR>
        -ing of its coming to sugar, till it was <BR>
        spoiled, for want of stiring. for y<SUP>e</SUP><BR>
        manner is to stir it when it comes <BR>
        almost to sugar. for which they were <BR>
        very angry &amp; would not give me any<BR>
        victuals. it being now spring we <BR>
        went <BR>
      </P>
      <p class="bigbody">(Page 14)</p>
      <p> went in canoes to Sorel, &amp; so soon as <BR>
        we got there the woman y<SUP>t</SUP> brought <BR>
        me victuals a cross y<SUP>e</SUP> river when I <BR>
        was there before. came &amp; desired y<SUP>e</SUP> in<BR>
        dians to let me go to y<SUP>e</SUP> fort, w<SUP>ch</SUP> y<SUP>y</SUP> <BR>
        consented to. I went but remembring <BR>
        y<SUP>e</SUP> bad effect of tarrying all <BR>
        night before durst not do so <BR>
        again, without y<SUP>e</SUP> indians leave. I <BR>
        went to y<SUP>e</SUP> indians (and carried y<SUP>m</SUP> <BR>
        some victuals) &amp; asked y<SUP>m</SUP> to let me <BR>
        Ly at y<SUP>e</SUP> fort which they granted. <BR>
        I kept here about a fortnight <BR>
&amp; Lay at y<SUP>e</SUP> fort eve-<BR>
        ry night. the french were very <BR>
        kind provided victuals for me &amp;<BR>
        would give me some to carry to y<SUP>e</SUP> <BR>
        indians, which pleased y<SUP>m</SUP> well. as we <BR>
        went back to St francis fort, we met <BR>
        a french canoe who told us y<SUP>t</SUP> the french <BR>
        Governour would come to St francis <BR>
        fort quickly, upon w<SUP>ch</SUP> my mistriss said <BR>
        to me your time is short you have <BR>
        to Live with me. (truly I hoped it <BR>
        was) when we came to St francis <BR>
        we went to masters isLand where<BR>
        I began to make preparation to <BR>
        plant corn, but before we be-<BR>
        gan to plant the Governour came<BR>
&amp; bought me after a Long parley, <BR>
        for 40 crowns. with him I went <BR>
        to Sorrel, where I met with captain <BR>
        Levingston &amp; several captives. <BR>
        capt. Levingston told me I should go <BR>
        home to NE. with him w<SUP>ch</SUP> revived me <BR>
      </P>
      <p class="bigbody">(Page 15)</p>
      <p> me much to think of going home.<BR>
        but the governour quickly al-<BR>
        -tered his mind, said I must not go. <BR>
        from hence I went down to quebec <BR>
        w<SUP>th</SUP> y<SUP>e</SUP> Lord intendant. when I<BR>
        came to Quebeck I found se-<BR>
        -veral English peo-ple y<SUP>t</SUP> were <BR>
        prisoners there. one m<SUP>rs</SUP> Hill took <BR>
        care of me cut my hair for me <BR>
        (now my hair was like an indi-<BR>
        -an one side Long &amp; the other short). <BR>
        She got me a shirt and a pair of <BR>
        breeches &amp; a jacket &amp; stockings,<BR>
&amp;c for me.<BR>
        from hence on y<SUP>e</SUP> 11 of <BR>
        may I was sent to Live with my <BR>
        Father at chatauriche. <SUP> </SUP>while I <BR>
        lived here y<SUP>e</SUP> french were very <BR>
        courteous &amp; kind to me as they were <BR>
        to my Father. this seemed almost <BR>
        home to me, because I was got to <BR>
        my Father who I had not seen for <BR>
        14 months. when m<SUP>r</SUP>. Dudley<SUP> </SUP>came <BR>
        to canada my father &amp; I was sent <BR>
        for up to Quebeck. when we were at <BR>
