Like his uncle and brother, Pierre survived the attack. He served in the French army in Europe from 1706-09. He returned to New France and married. Pierre engaged in the fur trade as well as farming. Pierre gained fame for his activities in later years as an explorer. In his quest to find the illusory Northwest Passage to the western sea and in attempts to discharge his many debts, he established trading posts, contacted many Native peoples and extended French presence as far west as Lake Winnipeg. These feats brought fame rather than fortune; deeply in debt, Pierre returned to Montreal in 1744. He died five years later, at the age of sixty-four.</P>
