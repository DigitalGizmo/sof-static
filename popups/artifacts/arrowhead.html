      <p CLASS="segment_title">Copper Arrowhead</p>
      <p CLASS="bigbody">During the first half of the 17th century, objects of copper and various copper alloys were of primary importance in European and Native American trade. Copper was a versatile medium that Native craftsmen adapted to a wide range of purposes. The sheet metal from copper kettles could be made into ornamental or utilitarian objects. The most common utilitarian use for sheet copper was as projectile points. Various shapes were made but by the second quarter of the 17th century, copper points were primarily triangular in form. In many cases, they were probably scored and cut from the heavier gauge metal from handle lugs on copper kettles. The use of copper instead of stone arrowheads had more to do with material preference than form or function. Copper's desirability among Native Americans was due in part to its traditional power-related properties. </p>
