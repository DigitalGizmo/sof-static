      <p CLASS="bigbody">This carved oak chest, now missing its legs and its lid, was made in Windsor, Connecticut, between 1640 and 1680. The arcaded-style carving on the front of the chest is continued on both ends, a design feature that is found on chests with Windsor histories. The chest, intended for storage of textiles, descended in the Hoyt family of Windsor. It probably reached Deerfield, Massachusetts, about 1682 with the arrival of David Hoyt (1651-1704). Hoyt's home was attacked during the 1704 raid on Deerfield, and this chest no doubt was an "eyewitness" to the scene. Hoyt was taken captive and died of starvation several months later. His 1704 probate inventory lists three chests,  including this one. The chest remained in the family until it was given to the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association in the late 19th century.
