      <p CLASS="segment_title">Timothy Edwards's Sermon Notes</p>
      <p CLASS="bigbody">Timothy Edwards (1669-1758) was a Congregational minister in East Windsor, Connecticut. Edwards was the son of a wealthy merchant and graduated from Harvard College in 1691. He was assigned to the East Windsor parish in 1694 where he remained for the rest of his life. He married Esther Stoddard, the daughter of a famous minister from Northampton, Massachusetts. They had eleven children. Edwards was known for delivering his sermons from small notes, rather than from fully written-out scripts. This example is typical. It mainly cites Biblical verses which he would recite from memory and use as centerpieces for his sermons. This sermon was delivered one week after the 1704 raid on Deerfield, Massachusetts. The raid was traumatic for Puritan New England. For many this disaster meant that God's favor had deserted them, and they turned to their ministers for guidance. Edwards' only son, Jonathan (1703-1758), would become one of the leading ministers of his day. </p>
