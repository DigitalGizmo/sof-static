<p class="subHead">Footnote # 1</p>
<p class="bigbody">The Connecticut River valley Indian named Chauk appears in the 17th century historical record only a few times. His name is also spelled Chawk, Chaque, Chauquatt, and Chawquatt. In 1658, "Chaque" or "Chauquatt" is recorded as a Podunk sachem living around Wethersfield who had been loyal to the English for 20 years. In February of 1667, "Chauk" alias "Chaque," signed the first deed giving Pocumtuck land to John Pynchon for the founding of Deerfield. (See footnotes #35, 36, and 54.)</p>

<p class="bigbody">"Podunk," or pautunke, loosely translates to a boggy place where one sinks in mire, referring to the low-lying river lands around present-day Hartford, Connecticut. See Huden 1962:189. For records of the first contact with the English, see DeForest 1852:55.</p>

<p class="bigbody">Ousamequin, meaning "yellow feather," was the given name of the 17th century Wampanoag sachem of Sowams, who was known to the Plymouth colonists as "Massasoit," a word that means "great sachem."  </p>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 4</p>
<p class="bigbody">The Wampanoag village of Patuxet was emptied by a plague that hit just a few years before the Mayflower landed in 1620. Despite that loss, Massasoit decided to broker a peaceful alliance and trading relationship with the English, in part to gain allies in his struggles with the Narragansett.</p>

<p class="bigbody">Jack Straw was just one of hundreds of New England Indians taken captive to, and returned from, England in the early 1600s. John Winthrop's journal entry for April 4, 1631, records:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">Wahginnacut a Sagamore vpon the river Quoanehtacut which lyes west of naraancet came to the Governor at Boston with Iohn Sagam. &amp; Iacke Straw (an Indian which had liued in England, &amp; had served Sir Walter Earle, &amp; was now turned Indian againe) &amp; diverse of their Sanopps: &amp; brought a lettre to the Gouernor from mr Endecott, to this effecte, that the said Wahgin. was verye desirous to have some Englishmen to come plante in his Countrye &amp; offered to finde them Corne &amp; give them yearly 80 skins of Beuer, &amp; that the Countrye was verye fruitfull &amp;c: &amp; wished that there might be 2: men sent with him to see the Countrye; the Gouernor entertained them at dinner but would send none with him; he discovered after that the said Sagamore is a verye treacherous man, &amp; at warre with the Pekoath (a farre greater Sagamore) [of the Pequot]...

<p class="bigbody">Although there are few records of the earliest arrangements, the surviving records from later years indicate that the Pynchons periodically hired Native men to transport goods. For example, on January 1, 1667, John Pynchon recorded a payment due from Nathaniel Ely "to an Indian Squompe for bringing up your 2 horses to Chikkupy River for which I agreed with him a bushel of Ind corne apiece." Native people also transported horses for Pynchon: on December 3, 1664, and April 13, 1666, payments were due "to an Indian for bringing my 4 horses," and "To the Indians for bringing your horses in winter." On July 11, 1671, Pynchon billed Reverend John Russell of Hadley 1 pound for "payment to the Indians who brought your Negro &amp; fetching up the canoe from the Ind fort." (In Pynchon Account Book III:152, 198, 522, unpublished manuscript, collections of the Connecticut Valley Historical Society.)</p>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 11</p>
<p class="bigbody">Smallpox is related to cowpox, a disease that emerged from the close proximity in which Europeans lived with their farm animals. Since exposure to cowpox does render one less vulnerable to smallpox, I use Chaque's exposure in this narrative as device to explain how some Native people may have developed immunities through limited exposure, which was the surest way to survive the disease before professional vaccination became available. </p>
<a name="12"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 12</p>
<p class="bigbody">Native peoples, despite their robust state of health, had never been exposed to many European diseases, and some plagues hit so quickly that there was no time to develop immunities, and few left to bury the dead. William Bradford relates this particular epidemic as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">I am now to relate some strange and remarkable passages. There was a company of people lived in the country up above in the River of Connecticut a great way from the trading house there, and were enemies to those Indians [Pequot] which lived about them [to the south], and of whom they stood in some fear, being a stout people. About a thousand of them had enclosed themselves in a fort which they had strongly palisadoed about. Three or four Dutchmen went up in the beginning of winter to live with them, to get their trade and prevent them for bringing it to the English or to fall into amity with them; but at spring to bring all down to their place. But their enterprise failed. For it pleased God to visit these Indians with a great sickness and such a mortality that of a thousand, above nine and a half hundred of them died, and many of them did rot above ground for want of burial. This spring also, those Indians that lived about their trading house there [Windsor], fell sick of the small pox and died most miserably (Bradford, [1634] 1981:301-2).</blockquote>
<a name="13"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 13</p>
<p class="bigbody">In 1656 Mohican Indians told a Dutch colonist that "before the arrival of the Christians, and before smallpox broke out amongst them, they were ten times as numerous as they now are" (Adriaen Van der Donck quoted in Calloway, <i>New Worlds for All: Indians, Europeans, and the Remaking of Early America</i>, Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press 1997:36). The spiritual beliefs of Native peoples were such that places of massive death would usually be abandoned for a time, to allow the spirits of the deceased to settle. That practice, unfortunately, encouraged English settlers to view such places as having been either willingly abandoned, or cleared "by God's providence."</p>

<p class="bigbody">See the 1666 deed with the signature "Chauque," in John Pynchon's hand, written alongside the marking used by Chauk. The original is in the collections of Memorial Hall Museum in Deerfield.</p>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 16</p>
<p class="bigbody">The Pynchon family's first encounters with Native people and Algonkian language were in the eastern part of the state, among the Wampanoag and Punkapog. In the eastern Massachusetts dialect, the locative endings &ndash;oag or &ndash;og are used in place names. In the western Massachusetts dialect, by comparison, &ndash;uk, -uck, or &ndash;ut are the most common locative endings. Thus, the Pynchons tended to call the Native homelands around what is now Northampton "Nolwatoag," while the Native people living there called the same place "Nonotuck." Throughout his life, and despite his massive correspondence, John Pynchon's spelling was notoriously inconsistent. As just one example, he called "Housatonic" by many variant spellings, including Ausatinnoag, Ausatinnog, Aussatinnewag, and Wissatinnewag. "Podunk" is one of the few Native place names that John Pynchon spelled consistently.</p>

<p class="bigbody">Traditionally, during hunting seasons, W&ocirc;banaki women would make new coats, moccasins, snowshoes, snares and packs for the men to use in travel and transport, while the men made their own spears, atlatls, knives, bows and arrows. When families hunted together, men would usually kill the game and women would skin the animals, cut the meat, and tan the hides. Women who hunted made their own gear, including sleds on which to carry large game back to camp. Children learned these skills by working alongside adults.</p>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 18</p>
<p class="bigbody">For an account of the events leading up to the attack on the Pequot fort at Mystic, see Salisbury 1982:203-225. The Mohegan and Narragansett were shocked at the slaughter, and oral traditions suggest that they agreed to shelter the surviving Pequot people to protect them from the English. Colonial authorities waxed poetic about the victory over the Pequot &ndash; for example, William Bradford wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">...the victory seemed a sweet sacrifice, and they gave the praise thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to enclose their enemies in their hands and give them so speedy a victory over so proud and insulting an enemy (Bradford [1637] 1981:331).</blockquote>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 20</p>
<p class="bigbody">The wampum tribute, paid in fathoms or 6 foot lengths, remained in effect for decades, but Native communities were continually charged with under-reporting. Some of the wampum went to cover the salaries of various scouts, interpreters, and military leaders for the colonies; the rest was used in Indian trade and tribute, with vast amounts flowing into Iroquois territory. In just one of many accounts of wampum tribute, the 1659 records of the United Colonies report: </p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">The whole account of wampam brought in; from long Iland forty fathom Robin seauenty eight fathom Cashawashett fifty fathom; in all one hundred sixty eight fathom wherof eighty fathom was deliuered to Thomas Stanton for his sallary; The remainder viz: eighty and eight fathom was left with Mr Talcott vpon account...(Meeting of the United Colonies Commissioners at Hartford, September 14, 1659 in Pulsifer 1859:226-7)</blockquote>
<a name="21"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 21</p>
<p class="bigbody">On March 24, 1638 William Pynchon was charged by the Connecticut General Court for supposedly keeping the Indians of Agawam, Woronoco, and Nonotuck in fear of him, that he might be considered the great English sachem of the valley, and for inducing certain Mohawk runners to sell him the beaver skins that were being sent to the Connecticut authorities as presents. Pynchon denied these charges, and explained the purchase of beaver from the Mohawk thusly:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">He could not Imagin that it was come as gift, because they mentioned noe such thing, but caled for trade. Besides it is their ordinary time in the time of snow in the beginning of Winter to trade their skinns &amp; a greate parte of this was such skins and not fitt for a gift to grate Sachims. . . He that told this to Mr Haynes was one of them that brought the 7 Sachims locks [the scalps of 7 Pequot leaders]. . ., and all that they said was this that the Mohawks did much love the English: and would be in friendshipp with them, &amp; destroy all Pequotts that came in their way. . . (Pynchon to Connecticut General Court in Green 1888:33)</blockquote>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 22</p>
<p class="bigbody">On March 21, 1638 John Mason wrote to William Pynchon of his own failed efforts to purchase corn from the Indians upriver:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">I am com to trade some corne with the Indians, and I have traded some at Woronoco, and I had purposed to have you to Nanotuck, but I mett with one of Nanotuck, here at Agaam [Agawam] and I would have traded some corne with him yester night, but he said he dared not without yr leave, for saide he is afraid of you, as alsoe are the Indians on the Riverside (Mason to Pynchon in Green 1888:25)</blockquote>
<a name="23"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 23</p>
<p class="bigbody">On February 9, 1638, the Connecticut General Court passed an order forbidding anyone to purchase corn directly from the Indians:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">"Noe man in this River, nor Agawam shall goe vpp River amonge the Indians, or at home at their houses, to trade for corne," under a penalty of five shillings per bushel. This was on the ground that "if euery man be at liberty to trucke with the Indians vppon the River, where the supply of corne in all likelihood is to bee had to furnish our necessities, the market of Corne amonge the Indians may be greatly advanced, to the prejudice of these plantations."(Sheldon 1890:113)</blockquote>
<a name="24"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 24</p>
<p class="bigbody">On March 9, 1638  William Pynchon arranged a contract to purchase 500 bushels of corn, at 5 shillings per bushel, from the Pocumtuck Indians, and agreed to have it delivered to Windsor and Hartford:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">Corn was not found at Agawam, Warranoco, or Naunatuck, and Pynchon or his agents, with generous bags of wampum, pushed up through the wilderness to Pocumtuck. . . The Pocumtuck had plenty of food to sell, and it must have been a busy and exciting day when Pynchon came among them to buy five hundred bushels of corn, bringing twelve thousand strings of wampum . . . files of women, with baskets on their backs, were soon seen threading the narrow pathways to the river; for in a short time a fleet of fifty canoes, freighted with Indian corn, was on its way down the Connecticut, to relieve the impending famine in the settlements below.

<p class="bigbody">This extension of credit resulted in a "beaver debt" that the Nonotuck and Pocumtuck were unable to pay, and this debt figures prominently in land transactions in the valley. For example, Maskalisk, sunksqua at Pocumtuck, signed over a parcel of land on August 26, 1672:</p>

<p class="bigbody">Among Algonkian Indian communities, children are considered to be in the direct lineage of their mother. In the event of a mother's death, her female relatives often adopt the children. Although the character of Keewatuway is fictional, her presence as the mother of Chauk's children, and her origin as a Pocumtuck woman, would help explain why a Pocumtuck war sachem like Onapequin would even bother stealing children from a Podunk man, at a time when the Pocumtuck were fighting on behalf of, not against, the Podunk. The names and precise ages of Chauk's children are not known, and there is no evidence that they were ever returned to him. Chauk disappears from the written records until he resurfaces to sign the first deed for Pocumtuck territory in 1666, a year after Onapequin's death.</p>

<p class="bigbody">In 1659, John Pynchon and a group of traders from eastern Massachusetts "proposed to settle a small plantation about 50 miles east of the Hudson and 40 to 50 miles west of Springfield that would ostensibly raise cattle to supply the Dutch at Fort Orange" (Bridenbaugh 1985, 56-57).  </p>
<p class="bigbody">In February of 1662, Pynchon hired Samuel Pearly and two other men to contruct the new truck house. In April, a trip to Housatonic was cancelled due to snow. By March 1663, apparently due to tensions among the Dutch and Mohawk over intrusions into their trade, Pynchon abandoned the venture. His records note efforts to dispose of large stocks of cloth, wampum, rum, shot and gunpowder. (Bridenbaugh 1985:57-59, 141-145).</p>

<p class="bigbody">Although it is often assumed that "Wissatinnewag" refers to Turners Falls, the Pynchon records reveal it to be a variation of Housatonic, or as John Pynchon sometimes spelled it, "Ausatinnoag" [Pynchon account book, February 22, 1662 and May, 1663]. As noted earlier, Pynchon's spelling was rarely consistent.</p>

<blockquote class="bigbody">As to the other Indians of the Connecticut River, as Pocumtuck, Nonotuck, Agawam, and further down, they deplore it exceedingly, repudiate the deed, and swear at the Sowquackicks; because they killed the Maquas and they will have nothing to do with them, for they are resolved to keep up their intercourse and friendship with the Maquaas as before. The Indians of the several places mentioned before request the sachems of the Dutch to assure the Maquaas and inform them how the matter is&#133;.The Sowquackicks have indeed broken the friendship with the Maquaas and we will let the Maquaas act according to their pleasure.  The Sowquackioks live at the head of the river of Caneticot and they are the ones, who fell upon the Maquaas [. . .] the Indians beyond them to the North [Pennacook and Cowass] and Northeast as far as Nologewook [Norridgewock], but the Southern Indians of Pocumtuck and Agawam and farther South assure that they will remain friends with the Maquaas and hope that they will live in peace with them.

But if the savages, their friends, would send hither some of their people with presents, then the friendship and peace would be so much firmer and he says, that he will then do his best.

<p class="bigbody">The Mohawk indicated that they were willing to make peace, but only on the condition that the Sokoki and Pocumtuck negotiate separately and do not support each other.

<blockquote class="bigbody">The Maquaas speak in our presence with the chiefs of the Katskil savages, Machackinemanau, keesje way and Wichpe; they remind them of the peace in which they live with all the tribes of the [Dutch colony] and along the [Hudson] river as far as the South river [near New York city] and they request the said savages, that they give their assistance to obtain peace with the Northern savages, for war is now inconvenient to them and they prefer to live in peace...</blockquote>

They reached Pocumtuck on May 22, after having been met by 10 Englishmen. The English expressed their doubts "whether the Maquaes who [live] among you [shall] keep their word. At Pocumtuck, two of Pynchon's sub-traders, Thomas Clarke and David Wilton (who the Dutch identified as Mr. Clerck and Mr. Wittens) translated for the Pocumtuck sachems:</p>

<blockquote class="bigbody">The Pacamtekocks answered, We have had no war for 36 years and have not troubled ourselves about our neighbors, the Soquackicks, when the Maquaes were at war with them last year. Let them send us a present, then we will release their prisoners and bring a present to their country, thus to renew our old friendship. This was agreed to and they promised to do it. Thereupon the savages left and we sent for the Soquackick chiefs, who had taken refuge in the aforesaid Castle, to the number of 35 or 36: we talked long with them to induce them to make peace, for the war had been brought on by them and they were now too weak to have [a chance] against the Maquaes. </blockquote>
