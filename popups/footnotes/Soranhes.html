<p class="subHead">Footnote # 1</p>
<p class="bigbody">The first missionaries to the Wendats were R&#34991;llets, a reform branch of the Franciscan order. The R&#34991;llets wore grey, hooded habits and wooden sandals; in England, they were nicknamed the "Greyfriars." The Jesuits, who later replaced the R&#34991;llets among the Wendats, wore black cassocks; Native peoples called them the Black Robes. We imagine Soranhes calling Father Viel by his first name because that seems to have been the Wendats' custom with Europeans; e.g., they called Father Jean de Br&#34917;uf "Echon," a Wendat transliteration for Jean (as pronounced by the French).</p>

<p class="bigbody">Br&#34917;uf writes of this visit that Amantacha was "not such as he ought to be, and as we had wished" (<i>Jesuit Relations</i>, 8:148), but does not supply a reason. Curing societies were traditional groups that performed special dances and other rituals, such as handling hot coals, to drive out sickness. Many Wendats viewed Christianity as a French curing society, and were baptized in hopes of surviving the epidemics of European diseases that devastated their people.</p>
