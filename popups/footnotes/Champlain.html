<p class="subHead">Footnote # 1</p>
<p class="bigbody">Numerous sources cite Champlain sailing as a young man with his uncle. In <i>Samuel de Champlain: Father of New France</i> (pg 18), Samuel E. Morison refers to Champlain joining his uncle&rsquo;s large sailing vessel, repatriating Spaniards expelled from France. Champlain himself writes of loving navigation and charting from an early age in his introduction to <i>Voyages</i>, written for the king of France in 1613.  These two events combine to paint a picture of Champlain learning the arts in voyages with his uncle.</p>

<p class="bigbody">In July, 1628, a British fleet under Sir David Kirk and his two brothers appeared in the harbor of Quebec and summoned Champlain to surrender; he refused. Kirk then captured a fleet of provisions bound for Quebec. Without those supplies the colony passed the winter in great distress, causing Champlain to surrender to Louis and David Kirk in 1629. Champlain was conveyed to England as a prisoner, and not freed until 1632.  He was reinstated as governor in 1633, when a treaty returned Quebec to the French.</p>

<p class="bigbody">"We spent this winter very pleasantly, and had good fare by means of the Order of Good Cheer which I established, and which everybody found beneficial to his health, and more profitable than all sorts of medicine we might have used. This Order consisted of a chain which we used to place with certain little ceremonies about the neck of one of our people, commissioning him for that day to go hunting. The next day it was conferred upon another, and so on in order. All vied with each other to see who could do the best, and bring back the finest game. We did not come off badly, nor did the Indians who were with us."</p>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 5</p>
<p class="bigbody">On July 29, 1609, Champlain and 9 French soldiers were traveling with 60 warriors from friendly allied tribes, when they encountered 200 Iroquois warriors on what is now Lake Champlain. It was 10 pm at night, and the Iroquois would not engage in a night time battle, wishing the sun to witness their valor. The Iroquois landed, and built a strong barricade. The Huron and allied tribes stayed the night in boats. Both groups shouted insults and boasted of their courage. The French stayed undercover, wishing to surprise the Iroquois. When morning came, both Native groups prepared to do battle. Champlain, hoping to show his courage and good will to his Native allies to gain their trust, advanced some paces ahead of the rest. The Iroquois were astounded to see an armored Frenchman. As they prepared to fire a volley of arrows, Champlain fired his musket at three leaders, killing them. The Native groups exchanged some fire, but the Iroquois fled into the woods, pursued by the musket-armed French. Fifty Iroquois were killed, and 10 or 12 taken prisoner. The warriors with Champlain suffered few injuries.</p>
