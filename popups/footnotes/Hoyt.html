<p class="subHead">Footnote # 1</p>
<p class="bigbody">Evan Haefeli and Kevin Sweeney, <i>Captors and Captives, The 1704 French and Indian Raid on Deerfield</i>, (Amherst and Boston: University of Massachusetts Press, 2003), p.115.</p>
<a name="2"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 2</p>
<p class="bigbody">Evan Haefeli and Kevin Sweeney propose that Jonathan Hoyt was the captive claimed by Tsohahisen, called Thaovenhosen by the Jesuit Louis D'Avaugour in his description of how the Wendat warrior argued against killing the captive in  retribution for the death of the Wendats' Great Chief. Haefeli and Sweeney, "Revisiting <i>The Redeemed Captive</i>: New Perspectives on the 1704 Deerfield Raid," in Colin G. Calloway, ed., <i>After King Philip's War: Presence and Persistence in Indian New England</i> (Hanover, NH: University Press of New England, 1997), pages 57-58 and Note on page 71.</p>
<a name="3"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 3</p>
<p class="bigbody">Stephen Williams writes: "While we tarried here, the French that were in the army passed by." ("What Befell Stephen Williams in his Captivity," page 3.) We have added the imagined detail that he and the Hoyt children saw each other in passing. </p>
<a name="4"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 4</p>
<p class="bigbody">We have no record of Jonathan's experience on the march, but Stephen and John Williams report similar treatment by the French when they arrived in New France.</p>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 5</p>
<p class="bigbody">Letter of Father Louis D'Avaugour to Reverend Father Joseph Germain, Superior General of the Canadian Missions, Concerning the Mission of Lorette in New France, October 7, 1710.  In Reuben Gold Thwaites, editor, <i>The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents</i>, 73 vols. (Cleveland, OH: The Burrows Brothers Company, 1896-1901), 66:169.</p>
<a name="6"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 6</p>
<p class="bigbody">Father Louis D'Avaugour describes the seasonal activities of the Lorette Wendats, including fishing and making canoes during the summer. He also describes Thaovenhosen's (Tsohahisen's) noble bearing ("his countenance breathes modesty, dignity, uprightness") and how he was widely admired: "the whole country considers [him] as a model of Christian integrity." (<i>The Jesuit Relations</i>, October 7, 1710; volume 66, pages 153 and 165).  Jonathan Hoyt's grandson Elihu reports that Jonathan "could speak their language fluently until his death." Elihu Hoyt, <i>A Brief Sketch of the First Settlement of Deerfield</i>, MA (Greenfield, MA: James P. Fogg, 1833), page 25.</p>
<a name="7"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 7</p>
<p class="bigbody">The conversation between William Dudley and Jonathan Hoyt and the transaction between Dudley and Tsohahisen are as described in Elihu Hoyt, <i>A Brief Sketch of the First Settlement of Deerfield</i>, MA (Greenfield, MA: James P. Fogg, 1833), pages 25-27. Hoyt gives the medium of exchange as dollars, which may be an anachronism, given that the colonies used the British monetary system based on the pound. (There were, however, some Spanish gold and silver dollars in circulation at the time.) The amount offered might have been 20 crowns; by comparison, the Kanienkehaka demanded 40 crowns in ransom for Stephen Williams, the son of Deerfield's minister, whom they understood to be a wealthy man of status. Twenty crowns equaled five pounds, at a time when the Reverend John Williams's annual salary was 80 pounds.</p>
