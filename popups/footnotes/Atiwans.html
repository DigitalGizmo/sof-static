<blockquote class="bigbody">The Maquas come to offer you peace, to forget all that has been done and to make a new covenant with you...The Pacamtuekocks answered, We have had no war for 36 years and have not troubled ourselves about our neighbors, the Soquackicks, when the Maquaes were at war with them last year. Let them send us a present, then we will release their prisoners and bring a present to their country, thus to renew our old friendship. This was agreed to and they promised to do it. Thereupon the savages left and we sent for the Soquackick chiefs, who had taken refuge in the aforesaid Castle, to the number of 35 or 36; we talked long with them to induce them to make peace, for the war had been brought on by them...</blockquote>

<blockquote class="bigbody">The village of Odanak, or Arosikantegouk, on the Saint Francis River was settled by Sokwakis about 1670. The original Sokwaki village was strengthened by repeated increments of Sokwakis and some Pennacooks. In 1700 it received all the Sokwakis and Pennacooks from the mission on the Chaudi&egrave;re River and some of the Eastern Abenakis. There were subsequent additions of Sokwakis, Abenakis, a few Algonquins, and the whole Pigwacket tribe, which arrived in 1707 and left in 1714. The Norridgewocks took refuge there twice but returned to the Kennebec River. Between 1696 and 1754, the entire population of the refugee village of Schaghticoke on the Hudson River moved to Odanak, some directly after a stopover at Missisquoi.</blockquote>
