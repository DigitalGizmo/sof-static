<p class="bigbody">William Bradford relates this epidemic as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">I am now to relate some strange and remarkable passages. There was a company of people lived in the country up above in the River of Connecticut a great way from the trading house there, and were enemies to those Indians Pequot which lived about them, and of whom they stood in some fear, being a stout people. About a thousand of them had enclosed themselves in a fort which they had strongly palisadoed about. Three or four Dutchmen went up in the beginning of winter to live with them, to get their trade and prevent them for bringing it to the English or to fall into amity with them; but at spring to bring all down to their place. But their enterprise failed. For it pleased God to visit these Indians with a great sickness and such a mortality that of a thousand, above nine and a half hundred of them died...This spring also, those Indians that lived about their trading house there Windsor, fell sick of the small pox and died most miserably (Bradford, [1634] 1981:301-2).</blockquote>

<p class="bigbody">Joseph Parsons, one of Pynchon's most successful sub-traders, was also highly successful as a land speculator. In 1647, he secured 42 1/2 acres of land in Longmeadow, which he sold to John Stebbins, and he was also one of the first owners of land in Northampton, a plot that extended from Market Street to the Bridge Street Cemetery (see Burt 1898:43). His home is still on its original houselot, on Bridge Street, on the grounds of Historic Northampton.</p>

<p class="bigbody">For examples of incidents in which Native people were involved in court disputes, see Smith, The Pynchon Court Record, 1961. The restrictions against further planting read in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">April 16, 1640  It is ordered yt Henry Smith &amp; Th: Mirack shall have power to restrayne ye Indians from breaking up any new grounde or from planting any yt was broken up ye last yeare, alsoe for ye Swampe yt is in ye neck they are to pitch up stakes yt sol ye Indians may be limited &amp; restrayned from enlarging ym selves in yt swampe...

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 10</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">I grant they are all wthin ye line of yr pattent, but you cannot say that therefore they are yr subjects nor yet within yr jurisdiction untill they have fully subjected themselves to yr government (wch I know they have not) &amp; untill you have bought their land: untill this be done they must be esteemed as an Independant free people, &amp; so they of Naunotak do all account themselves, &amp; doubtless wch ever goes with strength of men to disturb their peace at Naunotuk they will take it for no other than a hostile action. . . it may be of ill Consequence to ye English that intermedle in their matters . . . in that respect they threaten to be avenged on such as lay any hand upon them: &amp; our place [Springfield] is more obnoxtious to their malice then the Bay by farr, especially the Naunotuk Indians are desperate Spirites, for they have their dependence on the Mowhoaks or maquas who are the Terror of all Indians". </blockquote>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 12</p>
<p class="bigbody">For an account of the events leading up to the attack on the Pequot fort at Mystic, see Salisbury 1982:203-225. The Mohegan and Narragansett were shocked at the slaughter, and took in many of the surviving Pequot people. Colonial authorities waxed poetic about the victory over the Pequot, in horrifying language such as the following, from William Bradford:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">It was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the fire and the streams of blood...but the victory seemed a sweet sacrifice, and they gave the praise thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to enclose their enemies in their hands and give them so speedy a victory over so proud and insulting an enemy.</blockquote>

<a name="17"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 17</p>
<p class="bigbody">One of the earliest records of trading for Native clothing comes from the records of Plymouth Colony, where Native women were recorded as selling their old, worn, clothing and bedding to the English. Worn beaver was easier to process into felt, since the long guard hairs had already broken off, leaving the downy underfur. Fresh beaver had to be broken, or shorn, to remove the guard hairs. </p>
<p class="bigbody">Here are just a few examples of clothing transactions from William Pynchon's Account Book: In 1647, a Sokoki man named Asquamme brought in two large beavers to purchase 2 blue wool coats &ndash; when the trade fell a bit short, Ahimichqua paid the difference. On January 19, 1648, Momonhewi of Nonotuck paid three fathoms (6 feet) and two hands (about 6 inches) of wampum for a blue coat. On September 25, 1649, a Woronoco named Miattomp was trusted for a large purchase of 46 yards of red cotton for his kinsman Cowquatt, 27 yards for another relative, 10 yards of blue cloth for another, a red coat, stockings, and miscellaneous sundries, all to be paid for with the following season's furs.</p>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 20</p>
<p class="bigbody">Roger Williams, writing to the General Court of Massachusetts Bay on May 12, 1656, complained that the "hazardous frontier situation" was due to:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">...these Barbarians, who from their abundant supply of armes from the Dutch (and perfidious English all the land over) are full of our artillerie, which hath rendered them exceedingly insolent and threatening, especially the inlanders [Pocumtuck, Nonotuck and Sokoki] which have their supply from the fort of Aurania [Albany, NY].</blockquote>
