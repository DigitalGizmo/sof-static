<p class="bigbody">Louis-Hector de Calli&egrave;re, governor-general of New France at the time of the <a href="glossary/Great_Peace.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Great_Peace',''); return false">Great Peace of 1701</a>, was something of a paradox. On one hand, his colleagues considered him the opposite of diplomatic&mdash;his contemporary Bacqueville de La Potherie, the naval comptroller and historian, called him "hard and insensitive." La Potherie also portrayed Calli&egrave;re as vain and self-important, demanding exaggerated displays of honor and respect from others while treating political rivals rudely. On the other hand, Calli&egrave;re was a skillful diplomat and negotiator when it came to dealing with Native nations. He showed sensitivity in following their diplomatic protocols and rituals, and in his apparent understanding of their views of the issues.</p>
<p class="bigbody">
<span class="subHead">A Noble French Family</span>
</p>
<p class="bigbody">Louis-Hector de Calli&egrave;re was born in the province of Normandy, France, on November 12, 1648. His parents were members of the nobility. They were lords (seigneurs) of hereditary estates called <a href="glossary/seigneuries.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','seigneuries',''); return false">seigneuries</a> and had ties to powerful people in the government and military. Thanks to his connections, Louis-Hector's father Jacques became a brigadier-general in the army of Louis XIV and the mayor of the town of Cherbourg. While serving as mayor, he also wrote several books. Louis-Hector's older brother, Fran&ccedil;ois, was also a diplomat and a writer. Fran&ccedil;ois was one of three negotiators representing Louis XIV at the Treaty of Ryswyck (1697), which ended the <a href="glossary/Nine_Years_War.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Nine_Years_War',''); return false">Nine Years' War</a>. He wrote an influential book about the role of ambassadors. Perhaps most important for Louis-Hector's career, Fran&ccedil;ois became a private secretary to Louis XIV, a position of great power and influence&mdash;which he more than once wielded on his brother's behalf.</p>
<p class="bigbody">
<span class="subHead">From Soldier to Governor of Montreal</span>
</p>
<p class="bigbody">Louis-Hector entered the French army when he was about 16 years old. He became an infantry captain and fought in several of Louis XIV's European campaigns. It is not clear when he sailed to New France, but in 1684 he was appointed governor of Montreal. At the time, New France and the <a href="glossary/rotinonsionni.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','rotinonsionni',''); return false">Rotinonsionni</a> (Five Nations <a href="glossary/Iroquois.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquois',''); return false">Iroquois</a> Confederacy) were at war, as they often were, and <a href="../maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'Northeast',
        ''); return false">Montreal</a>, as the southwestern-most large French settlement, was vulnerable to attack. It was also the staging area for French attacks on the Iroquois. The governor of Montreal therefore had to be a military leader, a role that Calli&egrave;re filled well. The governor-general of New France, Brisay de Denonville, soon made Calli&egrave;re second in command for the whole colony.</p>
<p class="bigbody">One of Calli&egrave;re's first acts as governor of Montreal was to erect a <a href="glossary/Palisade.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Palisade',''); return false">palisade</a> around the town to protect it from Native attacks. In 1687, Calli&egrave;re and Phillipe de Rigaud de Vaudreuil, his rival for power and successor as governor of New France, accompanied Governor Denonville on an expedition against the <a href="glossary/Seneca.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Seneca',''); return false">Senecas</a>. Calli&egrave;re and Vaudreuil gained important experience in conducting campaigns in Native territory, although little actual fighting took place. The expedition sacked and burned four deserted Seneca villages and their fields and stores of corn, but served only to increase attacks on New France by the Iroquois, now spurred by the desire for revenge.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Calli&egrave;re was not just a soldier, but a strategist with a broad vision. He and Denonville devised a bold plan to contain the Rotinonsionni by conquering the English colony of New York. Such a conquest would deprive the Iroquois of English arms and trade, making them dependent on the French, and add the excellent harbor of New York City as well as the colony's fertile farmlands to the French king's holdings. Calli&egrave;re traveled to France in 1688, when England and France were still at peace, to present this plan to Louis XIV. The king approved the plan, but it was abandoned when the warships essential to its success were delayed.</p>
<p class="bigbody">The Nine Years' War began, and with France and England again at war, Iroquois attacks on New France increased. Calli&egrave;re fortified the <a href="glossary/seigneuries.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','seigneuries',''); return false">seigneuries</a> along the St. Lawrence River and organized sorties against Rotinonsionni war parties. In 1694, his military prowess was recognized with the Croix de Saint-Louis, the highest honor in France. Calli&egrave;re's strategy at this time was to keep up the military pressure on the Iroquois to weaken them, but not to destroy them entirely. As he wrote to the minister of the <a href="glossary/troupes.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','troupes',''); return false">marine</a>, the Iroquois had to stay "strong enough that the fear that our Odawas [Ottawas, Native ally of New France from the Great Lakes region] may have of them still serves as a barrier to prevent them from going over to the English to seek a good market for their merchandise." <a href="footnotes/Calliere.html" onclick="openLink(
        'footnotes',
        'Calliere',
        '1'); return false">(1)</a> As the architect of the Great Peace of 1701, Calliere's views changed later, but at this point he saw conflict between New France's Great Lakes Native allies and the Rotinonsionni as essential to French trade networks.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Despite suffering from gout&mdash;which may well have contributed to his irritable disposition&mdash;Calli&egrave;re led another large expedition of 2,000 men against the <a href="glossary/Onondagas.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Onondagas',''); return false">Onondagas</a> in 1696. Governor-General Frontenac was the nominal leader of the expedition, but because of his age (74), he was carried in a chair at the rear of the army. Perhaps in preparation for this expedition, Calli&egrave;re complained to Frontenac that he could not "find men enough to march in snow-shoes, carry and draw ammunition and stores so far, and storm a town in the very heart of the enemy's country" <a href="footnotes/Calliere.html" onclick="openLink(
        'footnotes',
        'Calliere',
        '2'); return false">(2)</a> &mdash;a statement revealing of his experience with frontier warfare. As in the expedition against the Senecas, the Onondagas abandoned their towns before the army arrived&mdash;so there was no real battle&mdash;and the French laid waste to Onondaga and <a href="glossary/Oneida.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Oneida',''); return false">Oneida</a> towns and fields of corn. This blow, along with attacks by the western Native nations, brought the once-mighty Rotinonsionni to the point of seeking peace with the French and their Native allies.</p>
<p class="bigbody">
<span class="subHead">Governor-General of New France</span>
</p>
<p class="bigbody">When Frontenac died in 1698, Calli&egrave;re was able to use his brother's influence at court to win the appointment as Frontenac's successor. As second-in-command, Calli&egrave;re had become acting governor-general upon Frontenac's death, but he had to compete with Vaudreuil for the permanent position. Both men sent emissaries to King Louis XIV. Calli&egrave;re's emissary reached Versailles first&mdash;by a matter of hours&mdash;and gained quick access to Louis-Hector's brother, Fran&ccedil;ois de Calli&egrave;re, and thereby to the king. Louis-Hector de Calli&egrave;re was officially appointed governor-general of New France in 1699.</p>
<p class="bigbody">"The policy of a governor of Canada does not consist so much in taking care of the French who are within the scope of his government as in maintaining a close union with the savage Nations that are his Allies," wrote Governor Calli&egrave;re. <a href="footnotes/Calliere.html" onclick="openLink(
        'footnotes',
        'Calliere',
        '3'); return false">(3)</a> This was a difficult task, given the many competing interests and traditional rivalries among the Native groups and Calli&egrave;re's duty to enforce edicts from Louis XIV and his ministers in France. One such edict banned fur trading in western Canada, a response to the glut of beaver furs on the French market. Calli&egrave;re recognized that this would endanger alliances with the western Native nations.</p>
<p class="bigbody">The Rotinonsionni, long-time English allies, were being pressured by the English government of New York not to make a separate peace with New France after the end of the Nine Years' War. However, the English did not provide any military assistance to help defend the Rotinonsionni against attacks by Native allies of the French from the Great Lakes region. Trying to remain independent and neutral between the two European powers, Onondaga and Oneida ambassadors made several trips to Montreal in 1699 to negotiate with the new governor, Calli&egrave;re. Over the next year, negotiations inched forward in Montreal and Onondaga (council fire of the Confederacy). Divisions within the <a href="glossary/Iroquois.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquois',''); return false">Five Nations</a> made it difficult for them to speak with one voice to the French, and Calli&egrave;re objected to delegations that did not include representatives of all the Iroquois nations.</p>

<span class="subHead">Toward the Great Peace</span>
</p>
<p class="bigbody">A preliminary agreement was reached after Calli&egrave;re sent to Onondaga three trusted ambassadors who had lived among the Iroquois, knew their languages, and were well skilled in Native diplomacy&mdash;Father Jacques <a href="people/Bruyas.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'Bruyas',
        'Prologue'); return false">Bruyas</a>, Chabert de Joncaire, and Le Moyne de Maricourt. Nineteen Iroquois delegates went to Montreal in September, 1700, and concluded a treaty almost a year before the Great Peace ceremonies in August of 1701. It included essentially the same provisions as the Great Peace document, but only a few of the Native allies from the Great Lakes region were present.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Governor Calli&egrave;re knew that some strenuous diplomacy was needed to bring his Native allies from the Great Lakes region into the agreement. As he stated in his opening remarks at the Great Peace ceremony: "Given that last year there were here only representatives of the Huron and the Ottawa when I made peace with the Iroquois for myself and all my allies, I deemed it necessary to send the Sieur de Courtemanche, and the Reverend Father Enjalran, to all of the other nations my allies that were absent to apprise them of what had taken place and to invite them to send Chiefs of each with the Iroquois prisoners in their possession in order that they may all listen together to my word." <a href="footnotes/Calliere.html" onclick="openLink(
        'footnotes',
        'Calliere',
        '4'); return false">(4)</a> Calli&egrave;re sent his ambassadors with multiple belts of <a href="artifacts/wampum.html" onclick="openLink(

        'wampum',
        ''); return false"></a><a href="glossary/wampum.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','wampum',''); return false">wampum</a> to confirm his message, and they split up and traveled all around the Great Lakes to deliver the message to the many nations there. They were assisted by several allied chiefs, notably Kondiaronk of the Huron (<a href="glossary/Wendat.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wendat',''); return false">Wendat</a>)-Petuns, who gave gifts to persuade reluctant leaders.</p>

Within this arena were arrayed 1300 Native ambassadors in all manner of finery, a mixture of Native dress and European accents. Some wore the French coats adorned with lace and gold braid that Calli&egrave;re had given to his best allies, along with their furs, face paint, and headdresses of deer antlers or feathers. Montreal citizens from all ranks of society were also in the crowd&mdash;priests, tradesmen, gentlemen, and ladies dressed in their finest. Around the enclosure stood impressive numbers of French soldiers.</p>

<p class="bigbody">The ceremony was conducted according to the diplomatic traditions of the Native nations, as the negotiations leading up to this day had been. It had taken several days for all of the nations to assemble, some having come from nearby <a href="glossary/Iroquoia.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquoia',''); return false">Iroquoia</a> and some from great distances. Delegates from the Native nations around the Great Lakes arrived in 200 canoes, which they massed together as they approached Montreal. Governor Calli&egrave;re, called <a href="glossary/Onontio.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Onontio',''); return false">Onontio</a> by the Natives, greeted them with gifts and ceremony. Over the next few days, he held private audiences with delegations from individual nations in the courtyard of his home. Each meeting was accompanied by the exchange of gifts. Calli&egrave;re had to be especially generous to counter the Natives' disappointment at the low prices Montreal merchants were paying for the furs they had brought to trade.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Some of the delicate issues discussed in the separate sessions were trade, prisoner exchanges, hunting territory, and Iroquois neutrality in wars between New France and New England. The prisoner issue almost scuttled the peace process because, although the Native allies from the Great Lakes region brought their <a href="glossary/Iroquois.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquois',''); return false">Iroquois</a> prisoners to the conference for return to their people, the <a href="glossary/rotinonsionni.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Rotinonsionni',''); return false">Rotinonsionni</a> did not bring their own prisoners in exchange. Calli&egrave;re intervened by offering to hold the Iroquois prisoners returned by the Great Lakes nations until the Iroquois returned their captives. La Potherie reports Calli&egrave;re telling the Iroquois not to "fail to redeem the error that you made by leaving them in your villages . . . in order that I may also satisfy my Allies . . . and convince them of your sincerity, so that starting this winter you can hunt together in peace. . . ." <a href="footnotes/Calliere.html" onclick="openLink(

Kondiaronk died of an epidemic that spread at the conference and threatened the lives of many Native delegates. Calli&egrave;re spared no effort in demonstrating his own and his government's grief at the loss of this great chief. (Rituals relating to condolence were very important to <a href="glossary/Iroquoian.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquoian',''); return false">Iroquoian</a> peoples in particular; the <a href="glossary/condolence_ritual.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','condolence_ritual',''); return false">Condolence Ceremony</a> is central to Rotinonsionni Council meetings.) He and his ministers visited the hut where Kondiaronk's body was lying in state to pay their respects, and mounted an elaborate funeral the next day. Sixty French troops escorted the funeral procession of Wendats, Ottawas, and French dignitaries to the church of Notre Dame, where Kondiaronk was buried after a Catholic service.</p>

<p class="bigbody">Louis-Hector de Calli&egrave;re, Governor-General of New France, achieved a diplomatic masterwork in orchestrating the Great Peace of 1701. As he wrote to Pontchartrain, the minister of the <a href="glossary/troupes.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','troupes',''); return false">marine</a>: "the separate peace made with the Iroquois in 1700, and which was made common in 1701 to all the known savage Nations, achieved for the King a certain, indisputable superiority in Canada over all New England." (7) Not only did the Great Peace end Iroquois attacks against French colonial settlements, which had been a drain on the settlements' ability to thrive, but it also won the neutrality of the <a href="glossary/rotinonsionni.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Rotinonsionni',''); return false">Rotinonsionni</a> in conflicts with the English&mdash;at least during the European powers' next war. When the <a href="glossary/Spanish_Succession.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Spanish_Succession',''); return false">War of the Spanish Succession</a> set France and England against one another again in 1702, the Great Peace affected the fate of New England settlements. Minister Pontchartrain urged Calli&egrave;re to mount a large-scale attack against New York. Calli&egrave;re felt that this would test Iroquois neutrality too severely, and instead pursued a strategy of enlisting other Native nations to make raids on New England. At a meeting in December, 1702, Calli&egrave;re appealed to the Eastern <a href="glossary/Wobanakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakiak',''); return false">W&ocirc;banakiak</a> (Abenakis) in Maine to attack English settlements there. He told them that the plunder they won from their raids would be combined with gifts from the French to give them a better income than they could enjoy if they remained at peace.</p>

<p class="bigbody">Before Calli&egrave;re could see his strategy carried out, he suffered a hemorrhage and died, on May 16, 1703. On the day before he died, he dictated a will, asking to be buried in the church of the Recollet fathers&mdash;with the exception of his heart, which he asked to be saved in a small casket for his brother Fran&ccedil;ois to claim. As he had never married, he left a few possessions to his personal aides and the balance to Fran&ccedil;ois. There is no record that Fran&ccedil;ois ever came from France to take possession of Louis-Hector's heart.</p>
