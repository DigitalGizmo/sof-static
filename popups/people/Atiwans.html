<p class="bigbody">Atiwans was taught, from an early age, how to carve a long double-pronged salmon spear for the annual fish runs, for catching the great red fish as they surged upriver at Peskeompskut, the place of the falls.

<p class="bigbody">In the spring of 1662, a few <a href="/popups/glossary/Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> families took the trail over the hills to join the Sokwakiak in fishing at the falls. But there were old grievances between these tribes, and in the spring of 1663, a group of Kanienkehaka warriors followed the same trail to make war on Atiwan's village. The losses at Sokoki were so terrible that the survivors decided to walk away from <a href="/popups/glossary/Paquayag.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Paquayag',''); return false">Paquayag</a>, the planting fields beside the river. Many headed north to <a href="/popups/glossary/Cowass.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Cowass',''); return false">Cowass</a>; some went as far as the French settlements. Atiwans and his family moved south, to join his father's kin at Pocumtuck.</p>
<p class="bigbody">At Pocumtuck, the sachem Onepequin sent messages to the Kanienkehaka that they were tired of making war, and that if the Kanienkehaka wished to make peace, they would be welcome to attend a council at Pocumtuck - "Let them send us a present, then we will release their prisoners and bring a present to their country, thus to renew our old friendship." <a href="/popups/footnotes/Atiwans.html" onclick="openLink(

</p>
<p class="bigbody">But the people at Pocumtuck were not of one mind.

When the Kanienkehaka ambassador Saheda and his ambassadors left Albany in July of 1664, two years after the attack on Sokoki, they were holding <a href="/popups/glossary/wampum.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','wampum',''); return false">wampum</a> for peace, not weapons for war.

While John Pynchon was trying to arrange a peace between these former enemies, the English at Albany were busy securing a new treaty with the Kanienkehaka. The agreement, signed on September 24, 1664, promised that the Dutch and English at Albany would make peace with the Mohican, continue trade with the Kanienkehaka, and refuse any assistance to the "Ondiakes (Sokoki), Pinnekooks (Pennacook), and Pacamtokookes (Pocumtuck)." <a href="/popups/footnotes/Atiwans.html" onclick="openLink(

<p class="bigbody">In November of 1664, Kanienkehaka war parties, supplied with guns, powder and shot from Fort Albany, set out to the east across the road that would come to be known as "the Mohawk Trail." A large comet was visible in the sky when Kanienkahka warriors attacked the fort at Pocumtuck, killing <a href="/popups/glossary/Onapequin.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Onapequin',''); return false">Onapequin</a> and his family. John Winthrop Jr. wrote to Pynchon that the survivors "are all fled from Pacomtuck &amp; Squakeage &amp; Woruntuck, &amp; it seemes some of them to your parts, but there are 2 forts of them neere Springfield." <a href="/popups/footnotes/Atiwans.html" onclick="openLink(

<p class="bigbody">Atiwans' family moved farther south along the river, with the refugees from Pocumtuck, to Nonotuck. In April of 1664, the Nonotuck had decided to build a fortified village at "Fort Hill," across the <a href="/popups/glossary/Cappawonganik.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Cappawonganik',''); return false">Cappawonganik</a>, or Mill River, from the fledgling settlement of Northampton, to improve access to Pynchon's sub-traders. There, Major John Pynchon had agreed to plow the Nonotuck corn fields every year in exchange for land to settle on. <a href="/popups/footnotes/Atiwans.html" onclick="openLink(
        'footnotes',
        'Atiwans',

Pynchon forbade the Nonotuck Indians to take in any more refugees from other places. <a href="/popups/footnotes/Atiwans.html" onclick="openLink(

<p class="bigbody">While they were living at Nonotuck, young Atiwans spent much of his time in town, having struck up a friendship with the English blacksmith. The smith gave the Indian boy a newly-forged <a href="/popups/artifacts/hatchet.html" onclick="openLink(
        'artifacts',
        'hatchet',
        ''); return false">hatchet</a>, joking that he hoped young Atiwans would remember to never use it against his English friends.</p>
<p class="bigbody">By 1675, all of the valley Natives had tired of living under English laws, and refused, when pressed by <a href="/popups/glossary/lathrop.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','lathrop',''); return false">Captain Thomas Lathrop</a>, to give up their guns and other weapons. When word came to Nonotuck of the growing success of the Wampanoag chief <a href="/popups/glossary/Metacoms_War.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Metacoms_War',''); return false">Metacom's rebellion</a>, Atiwans' father, along with 15 year-old Atiwans, cut his hair, sharpened his axe, and painted his face for war.

On September 18, when word came that a large wagon train of English men and supplies were headed for Pocumtuck, they struck Captain Lathrop's own company, near <a href="/popups/glossary/wequamps.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','wequamps',''); return false">Wequamps</a>, at the place that would later be called "<a href="/popups/glossary/Bloody_Brook.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Bloody_Brook',''); return false">Bloody Brook</a>."

<p class="bigbody">In April of 1676, after a long, cold, and relatively quiet winter, Atiwans helped his mother and kinfolk clear the fields so the women could once again plant corn at Pocumtuck.

There, they were joined by refugees from other parts of New England &ndash; old men, women, and children from <a href="/popups/glossary/Wampanoag.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wampanoag',''); return false">Wampanoag</a> and <a href="/popups/glossary/Narragansett.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Narragansett',''); return false">Narragansett</a> territory from the southeast, who had been brought here to the safe place at the falls.</p>
<p class="bigbody">On the night of May 14, a war party brought an English captive named Thomas Reede to the camp at the falls; in the night, Reede escaped and made his way to Northampton. Five days later, Reede and Captain Turner would bring death to the fishing place. Atiwans' sisters, brothers, mother and elders were all killed during what the English would later call "The Falls Fight."</p>
<p class="bigbody">Now, standing here in the fishing place, after 15 winters and so much death had passed, with his father's old fish spear in hand, Atiwans looked around at the empty places that had once been filled with people. Looking into the future, he dreamed more abandoned villages, like abandoned beaver ponds, slowly transforming from watery marsh into solid meadow, until all evidence of the original inhabitants had vanished. The thought troubled him. When the sachem <a href="/popups/glossary/Shattookquis.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Shattookquis',''); return false">Shattookquis</a> came to gather up the survivors, he announced that the Governor of New York had arranged another safe place for the valley peoples, in the northern part of Mohican territory, at <a href="/popups/glossary/schaghticoke.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','schaghticoke',''); return false">Schaghticoke</a>.

<p class="bigbody">Here, life was good until the English grew suspicious, and complained to Governor Andros that "his Indians" were a threat to the safety of the settlements. The Pocumtuck sachem Chauk, who could speak good English, reminded Andros that Major Pynchon himself had promised that the papers Chauk had signed a generation ago promised continued rights of the people to hunt and fish and plant in this place <a href="/popups/footnotes/Atiwans.html" onclick="openLink(

<p class="bigbody">In all the years they lived at Odanak, Atiwans spent most of his time hunting, or scouting for the French soldiers, who paid for his time in blankets, guns, and powder and shot. There, the French missionaries offered them a frame house to live in. Megunisqua, tired of building new wigwams only to see them removed by the English, accepted. The first time the <a href="/popups/glossary/black_robes.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','black_robes',''); return false">Black Robes</a> invited her into the church she refused. But after six years of seeing all of her neighbors wearing the silver crosses, and hearing them speak of the protection that the white god promised, Megunisqua had to hear for herself. She and all of her children started going to the church every Sunday.</p>

<p class="bigbody">In 1699, when a French officer came to Odanak for a council, he was much impressed with Atiwans. Unlike the younger men who were clamoring for adventure, this man was thoughtful, quiet, and firm, and even the most brash leaders would often look his way before making any boasts. The Frenchman put a new <a href="/popups/artifacts/musket.html" onclick="openLink(
        'artifacts',
        'musket',
        ''); return false">French musket</a> into his hands, saying that Atiwans "had the makings of a fine war leader." In the winter of 1703, during a council with the <a href="/popups/glossary/Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> and the <a href="/popups/glossary/Wendat.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wendat',''); return false">Wendat</a>, Atiwans stood up and said he was ready to carry war to Deerfield.</p>

The most successful W&ocirc;banaki leaders knew that one had to lead by example and accomodation, not by force, and look out for ones' comrades more than oneself.</p>

<span class="segment_title">The Attack on Deerfield</span>
<br>
<span class="bigbody">February 29, 1704</span>
</p>
<p class="bigbody">Atiwans was most familiar with the layout of Deerfield, having seen the wigwams and cornfields that had preceded it, overlain with the foundations of the English houses that were laid in ashes in 1676, and having closely watched the rebuilding in the decades after. For Atiwans, this path was one he knew even in his sleep. Even with English houses and roads in the way, he could plot every part of this territory in his mind's eye. Each part of this place called to him, as did the memories of so many of his relatives&mdash;his father, killed at <a href="/popups/glossary/wequamps.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','wequamps',''); return false">Wequamps</a>, in the battle the English called "<a href="/popups/glossary/Bloody_Brook.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Bloody_Brook',''); return false">Bloody Brook</a>," his mother and siblings, dead at <a href="/popups/glossary/Peskeompskut.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Peskeompskut',''); return false">Peskeompskut</a>; and so many others of his kin, scattered between <a href="/maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(

<p class="bigbody">
<span class="subHead">In the Midst of the Attack</span>
</p>
<p class="bigbody">Amid the noise and confusion in the early morning attack on Deerfield, Atiwans could be seen gesturing to the other W&ocirc;banaki men, and looking to cover others' backs, even as he surged into the thickest fighting. He quickly sized up the layout of the town, and guided men to each of the houses where the town's leaders lived. </p>
<p class="bigbody">Twenty of the <a href="/popups/glossary/Wobanakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakiak',''); return false">W&ocirc;banakiak</a> and <a href="/popups/glossary/Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> had directed their attack on the house of the Reverend <a href="/popups/people/JohnWilliams.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'JohnWilliams',
        'Attack'); return false">John Williams</a>. As they rushed in the door, the minister ran to his dresser where he grabbed a pistol, raised it to Atiwans' chest and pulled the trigger. The dry snap echoed in the room, and all motion stopped&mdash;it took a moment for everyone to realize that the pistol had misfired. Atiwans was one of three men to seize the Reverend simultaneously; they almost laughed at their own overeagerness. <a href="/popups/footnotes/Atiwans.html" onclick="openLink(
        'footnotes',
        'Atiwans',

<p class="bigbody">Atiwans, as one of the elder members of the war party, took the lead of those <a href="/popups/glossary/Wobanakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakiak',''); return false">W&ocirc;banakiak</a> who had taken captives, who were now being forced, dragged, and, in some cases, carried, as they rushed away from the burning town of <a href="/maps/deerfield.html" onclick="openLink(

Several of the <a href="/popups/glossary/Pocumtuck.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Pocumtuck',''); return false">Pocumtuck</a> and <a href="/popups/glossary/Sokwakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Sokwakiak',''); return false">Sokoki</a> men were gathering up those few Indians who had died in the attack, and dragging their bodies out of the stockade, to conceal in the places beside the river where other Native dead lay buried. Atiwans was greatly saddened at the loss of his kinsman, but he was heartened when a young Nonotuck man, <a href="/popups/glossary/Wallena.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wallena',''); return false">Wallena</a>, joined him to help guard Williams.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Atiwans and Wallena took personal responsibility for the minister. The members of the Williams family had been separated, and Mrs. Williams, like other white women who were so frail after giving birth, was obviously struggling. It was not clear if she was strong enough to make this journey. As they stopped at the foot of the small rising hill, just beyond the Pocumtuck River, Atiwans and Williams looked back to see the flames of the town behind them. They could hear the shouts of the <a href="/popups/glossary/Militiamen.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Militiamen',''); return false">militiamen</a> that had come to Deerfield's rescue, too late.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Atiwans turned back to his captive, giving Williams a pair of warm, dry, <a href="/popups/artifacts/moccasins.html" onclick="openLink(
        'artifacts',
        'moccasins',
        ''); return false">winter moccasins</a> to wear in place of his wet English shoes. He cast a disdainful look every time the minister audibly bemoaned his fate, mumbling bits of scripture and praying to God to "save him from the heathens." Atiwans amused himself with the thought that many of the W&ocirc;banakiak, with their crosses and prayers, and their attention to the Catholic Priests, were more devout Christians than many of the hard-drinking, ill-mannered English. Even though he understood English perfectly well, Atiwans motioned to Wallena every time the Minister queried him, to avoid having to listen to the man's prayers.</p>

<p class="bigbody">On the second day, Atiwans moved from the head of the party to the rear, on hearing reports that they might be followed. When he saw Williams' wife losing even more strength, Wallena decided to allow John Williams to walk with his wife for a while, so they could pray together. They were separated again when Atiwans returned. <a href="/popups/footnotes/Atiwans.html" onclick="openLink(

<p class="bigbody">At the river crossing Mrs. Eunice Williams fell in the icy water, and Atiwans' kinsman nearly drowned themselves trying to fish her out, caught up in her heavy skirts. Atiwans left John Willliams and ran back to the river, where he saw her gasping on the bank, blood pooling under her from renewed hemmoraging. He knew that she could not possibly survive; he turned away when one of the Pocumtuck men raised his hatchet. <a href="/popups/footnotes/Atiwans.html" onclick="openLink(

</p>
<p class="bigbody">The rest of the party had stopped to rest, and when Atiwans returned to the lead, he told Williams that his wife was dead. The Minister broke down in heaving sobs, crying that his "God had foresaken him in this dreadful place." Atiwans, who had seen so many of his own kin killed, and who had seen his own homeland transformed from a paradise to hell by the English invaders, reproached the Minister for his weakness, and forced him to walk. </p>

<br>
<span class="bigbody"></span>
</p>
<p class="bigbody">Atiwans is a composite fictional character, representing those Connecticut River valley sachems who led war parties against the English settlers, after having relocated to northern Abenaki villages. The movements of Atiwans and his family between 1662 and 1704 are based on the actual historical records of Sokoki and Pocumtuck relocations (see citations in footnotes). The Reverend John Williams was known to have been captured   by an Abenaki, whose actual name is unknown. Atiwans' actions during the 1704 attack are based on the events recorded in John Williams' account. This narrative was written by Marge Bruchac.</p>
