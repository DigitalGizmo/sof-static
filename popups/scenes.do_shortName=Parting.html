        ''); return false"></a><a href="glossary.do_shortName=Wassebastecook.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wassebastecook',''); return false">Wassebastecook</a>, the White River. Here they split up to follow separate routes to their final destinations&mdash;the <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Pennacook.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Pennacook',''); return false">Pennacook</a>, <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Wendat.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wendat',''); return false">Wendats</a> (Huron), and French traveled north along the Connecticut, while the <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Wobanakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakiak',''); return false">W&ocirc;banakiak</a> from the west and the <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> (Mohawk) traveled northwest along the White River. Captive families were separated, each captive going with his or her master.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Hard traveling:</span> To get here, the raiders and captives had walked about 140 miles through wet, heavy snow. In the first three days of their journey, they covered only about 20 miles, across wooded hills to a camp on the Connecticut River in <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Sokwakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Sokwakiak',''); return false">Sokwakiak</a> territory, where sleds and other supplies were cached. From there, they walked north on the frozen Connecticut for four days, up to their ankles in slush and ice, at a pace of about 20 miles a day. Food was running low, but it was parceled out to be shared by captives and captors alike. Less fit and less used to winter travel than their captors, the captives also lacked <a href="artifacts.do_shortName=snowshoes.html" onclick="openLink(
        'artifacts',
        'snowshoes',
        ''); return false">snowshoes</a> and suffered from cut, swollen feet. A number of weakened captives were killed along the way, as were young children if their captors could no longer carry them.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Survival:</span> The raiding party felt confident that they were now beyond the reach of <a href="glossary.do_shortName=English.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','English',''); return false">English</a> pursuers, so they felt free to break into smaller groups and travel at a slower pace. Smaller groups were necessary for hunting, which was now urgently needed to prevent starvation. It would take at least two more weeks to reach their destinations.</p>
<p>
<i>What would be the fate of the captives?</i>
</p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">Wobanakiak</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Northwest journey:</span> At the junction of the two rivers, the Western <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Wobanakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakiak',''); return false">W&ocirc;banakiak</a> parted from their <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Pennacook.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Pennacook',''); return false">Pennacook</a> kinsmen, and traveled northwest with the <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> (Mohawk). Most of the English captives went with them, following trails that took the easiest paths up <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Wassebastecook.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wassebastecook',''); return false">Wassebastecook</a> and through the rough terrain of the <a href="../maps/march.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'march',
        ''); return false">Green Mountains</a>. Unused to deprivation, the captives were dependent on their captors' hunting abilities to keep starvation at bay as they traveled in smaller groups. Once over the mountains, they traveled up the frozen face of <a href="audio_pronounce.do_shortName=.html" onclick="openLink(
        'audio_pronounce',
        '',
        ''); return false"></a><a href="glossary.do_shortName=Pitawbakw.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Pitawbakw',''); return false"></a>Pitawbakw, or Lake Champlain. Some went directly north to the village of <a href="../maps/march.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'march',
        ''); return false">St. Francis</a>; others stopped at the W&ocirc;banaki village of Missisquoi, where they spent some time hunting. </p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Captive fates:</span> The <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Pennacook.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Pennacook',''); return false">Pennacook</a> and their few captives kept traveling on the Connecticut, north toward the meadows at <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Cowass.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Cowass',''); return false">Cowass</a>, sharing in what little food was available. <a href="people.do_shortName=Wattanummon.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'Wattanummon',
        'Parting'); return false">Wattanummon</a> kept young <a href="people.do_shortName=StephenWilliams.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'StephenWilliams',
        'Parting'); return false">Stephen Williams</a> close by him, evaluating him as a candidate for adoption as he looked to meet up with his own kin. Stephen showed promise when he helped Wattanummon with hunting and other chores. By contrast, two adult male captives, David Hoyt and Jacob Hickson from Deerfield, did not fare as well. They were not tested as potential adoptees, were forced to do hard work, and eventually starved to death.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Diplomacy:</span> At the close of a hard winter, a delegation of Pennacook traveled to <a href="../maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'northeast',
        ''); return false">Montreal</a> to thank <a href="artifacts.do_shortName=vaudreuil_portrait.html" onclick="openLink(
        'artifacts',
        'vaudreuil_portrait',
        ''); return false">Governor Vaudreuil</a> for mounting the raid against Deerfield. Both sides were satisfied that the raid was successful. The Pennacook were particularly pleased at how the new Native alliance had helped them to strike back at English incursions into W&ocirc;banaki territory.</p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">English</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Families separated:</span> "There the river parted and I went up one branch, my father . . . the other. I never saw my father for 14 months after." <a href="footnotes.do_shortName=Parting.html" onclick="openLink(
        'footnotes',
        'Parting',
        '1'); return false">(1)</a> For <a href="people.do_shortName=StephenWilliams.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'StephenWilliams',
        'Parting'); return false">Stephen Williams</a> and the other captives, this crossroads brought a new loss. Separated, they would no longer know their loved ones' fate. That fate was linked more than ever to their status as captives and their captors' ability to hunt. As a valuable candidate for ransom, <a href="people.do_shortName=JohnWilliams.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'JohnWilliams',
        'Parting'); return false">John Williams</a> was well fed and outfitted with <a href="artifacts.do_shortName=snowshoes.html" onclick="openLink(
        'artifacts',
        'snowshoes',
        ''); return false"></a>snowshoes made from one of the five moose his masters killed.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Survival fates:</span> Eighty-nine of the 112 captives reached <a href="glossary.do_shortName=New_France.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','New_France',''); return false">New France</a>. Although women and children were the most favored candidates for adoption, many perished on this march because they had difficulty keeping up. Ten out of 23 adult women&mdash;some elderly, others weakened by pregnancy or recent childbirth, some injured or otherwise unable to continue&mdash;died at their captors' hands. Eight children were also killed, half of whom were two years old or younger and thus unable to travel independently. Teenagers, adult men, and older children had a better chance of survival. </p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">"Revival in our bondage"</span>: The captives interpreted their trials as God's punishment for their sins, and accepted God's will. When the raiders allowed a Sunday rest on the sixth day of the march, John Williams preached on a passage from Lamentations 1:18. "The Lord is righteous, for I have rebelled against his commandment. . . . My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity." The captives identified with the Israelites' Babylonian captivity; Williams said their captors asked them to "Sing us one of Zion's songs." They sang a psalm, and the Natives mocked and loudly out-sang them.  </p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">French</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Home to New France:</span> At the junction of the <a href="../maps/march.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'march',
        ''); return false">Connecticut and White</a> rivers, <a href="people.do_shortName=Hertel.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'Hertel',
        'Parting'); return false">De Rouville's</a> French soldiers and canadien <a href="glossary.do_shortName=militiamen.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','militiamen',''); return false">militiamen</a> parted from their Native allies. They felt they were beyond the reach of English pursuit at this point, and provisions to support such a large group were exhausted. The Natives could reach home with their captives by traveling in small hunting bands, which was a traditional way of winter survival. The French followed the route up the Connecticut taken by the <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Pennacook.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Pennacook',''); return false">Pennacook</a>, then turned northwest along the Wells River to reach Lake Champlain and ultimately <a href="../maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'northeast',
        ''); return false">Montreal</a>. With 10 captives and their wounded to care for, the French traveled slowly. They would deliver their prisoners to authorities in Montreal, where the captives would likely be questioned for information about the English. </p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">French and captives:</span> As the groups dispersed, the "march" was no longer a military expedition led by Lieutenant de Rouville. Up to this point, De Rouville had communicated with the captives through <a href="people.do_shortName=JohnWilliams.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'JohnWilliams',
        'Parting'); return false">John Williams</a>, considered the leader of the English. After captive Joseph Alexander escaped during the first night of the march, De Rouville told Williams "to tell the English, that if any more made their escape, they would burn the rest of the prisoners." <a href="footnotes.do_shortName=Parting.html" onclick="openLink(
        'footnotes',
        'Parting',
        '2'); return false">(2)</a> De Rouville knew that captives had become part of a new French-Native trade relationship. The exchange of captives for ransom compensated, in part, for the decline of the beaver fur trade. The French hoped that this trade would prevent Native peoples from developing alternative trade alliances with the English.</p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">KanienKehaka</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">New struggles:</span> The <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> (Mohawk), carrying their young captives, parted from their French and Native allies&mdash;the <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Pennacook.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Pennacook',''); return false">Pennacook</a> and the <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Wendat.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wendat',''); return false">Wendats</a> (Huron)&mdash;and headed northwest along the <a href="../maps/march.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'march',
        ''); return false">White River</a> with the Western <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Wobanakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakiak',''); return false">W&ocirc;banakiak</a>. As they traveled into the Green Mountains, they broke into small parties so they could hunt separate territories. The terrain was rougher here, and hunger weakened both captives and captors. Children were now at greater risk because there were fewer men to share the burden of carrying them. The Kanienkehaka man carrying six-year-old Elizabeth Hawks on his shoulders struggled with her and his heavy pack in the deep snow. Finally he gave up&mdash;and killed her.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Council:</span> Early in the march, leaders of all of the Native groups met in council to resolve a potential conflict. In the chaos of the attack, some fighters seized several captives while others claimed none. Since sharing and reciprocity were important values in Native societies, and since captives were evidence of a warrior's success, this unequal distribution of captives caused grumbling. The leaders redistributed the captives and restored harmony.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Ransom:</span> As they reached home territory, Kanienkehaka from <a href="../maps/march.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'march',
        ''); return false">Kahnawake</a> went straight to their village, but the group from <a href="../maps/march.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'march',
        ''); return false">Sault-au-R&eacute;collet</a> had to pass through Montreal on their way. As they did, they sold some captives&mdash;including <a href="people.do_shortName=JohnWilliams.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'JohnWilliams',
        'Parting'); return false">John Williams</a>'s son Samuel&mdash;to French colonists. Montreal was the center of French-Native trade, both in furs and the exchange of captives for ransom.</p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">Wendat</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Northward:</span> When the expedition parted ways at the junction of the <a href="../maps/march.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'march',
        ''); return false">Connecticut and White</a> Rivers, the small band of <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Wendat.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wendat',''); return false">Wendats</a> (Huron) set off up the Connecticut River with their few captives. Their home village of <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Lorette.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Lorette',''); return false">Lorette</a> was almost due north, just northwest of <a href="../maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'northeast',
        ''); return false">Quebec</a>. They traveled with <a href="people.do_shortName=Hertel.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'Hertel',
        'Parting'); return false">De Rouville</a>'s men until they reached Chambly, when the Wendats continued along the Saint Lawrence to Lorette.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Conflicting values:</span> The Wendats had lost their esteemed leader, who was wounded in the attack on the Stebbins house and died early in the march. <a href="glossary.do_shortName=mourning_war.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Mourning_War',''); return false">Mourning-war</a> tradition demanded retribution for his loss&mdash;in the form of ritual torture and death by burning of a captive. During a council meeting to redistribute captives on the third day of the march, a dispute arose among the Wendats concerning how they would avenge their chief's death. The <a href="glossary.do_shortName=French.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','French',''); return false">French</a> considered the Wendats the most devout of the Native Christians. Like other Native groups, though, they integrated their new religion with traditional spirituality and values. In fact, the French admired them as much for their fierceness in battle as for their piety&mdash;but Christian missionaries had tried to convince them to stop the ritual torture of captives. <a href="people.do_shortName=Tsohahisen.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'Tsohahisen',
        'Parting'); return false">Tsohahisen</a>, a young relative of the chief, was both exceptionally devout and a notably fierce warrior; he settled the dispute by appealing to both traditional and Christian values. </p>
