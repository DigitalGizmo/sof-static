<p class="subHead">Footnote # 3</p>
<p class="bigbody">Gordon Day's work, <i>The Identity of the Saint Francis Indians</i> (1981), reveals the complexity of the various Native peoples who came to be known collectively as the "Saint Francis Abenaki." Colin Calloway, John Moody, William Haviland, Marjorie Power, and Frederick Wiseman have all written at length about the identity of the Missisquoi Abenaki. David Stewart Smith is one of the most reliable sources for writing about the Pennacook Abenaki. Although much information has been preserved in the New York colonial documents and court records, there is not, as yet, any comparable source that explores the background of the Native peoples who inhabited Schaghticoke, New York.</p>
<a name="4"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 4</p>
<p class="bigbody">Historical errors about the origins of Schaghticoke and Odanak abound in secondary sources. The most common mistakes include the following: assuming that the Schaghticoke Indians in New York were all Mohican; confusing the Schaghticoke Indians in New York with the Schaghticoke Tribe in Connecticut; confusing the Pennacook in New Hampshire with the Pequot in Connecticut; confusing the Mohican in New York with the Mohegan in Connecticut; confusing the Cowass in Vermont with the place name Cohoes in New York; mistaking the Saco Indians of Maine for the Sokoki Indians of the Connecticut River Valley; assuming that Odanak was the origin of the Abenaki people of Vermont and New Hampshire; and confusing Eastern Abenaki people in Maine with Western Abenaki people in Vermont. The state borders around Vermont, New Hampshire, and New York, and the international border between the United States and Canada, all of which artificially cut through Western Abenaki territory, add to the confusion.</p>
<a name="5"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 5</p>
<p class="bigbody">Many historians have been confused by the presence of different Native settlements by the same name during the 1600s. Russell Handsman and Trudie Lamb Richmond have argued that this kind of confusion can be blamed on the stereotypes, discourse of disappearance, and broad generalizations that American writers have long used in writing regional Native histories (see "Confronting Colonialism: The Mahican and Schaghticoke Peoples and Us" Handsman and Richmond 1996). Lazy scholarship is also responsible for the chronic confusion between the Mohican of New York and the Mohegan of Connecticut, who are two politically and historically distinct tribal groups.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Readers should be forwarned that 19th and 20th century historical writers and novelists often mixed fact, fiction, folklore, and oral tradition, making for compelling reading that inspires considerable confusion. For example, James Fenimore Cooper's popular 1830s novel <i>Last of the Mohicans</i> used the name of a 17th century Connecticut Mohegan sachem, Uncas, in a fictional 18th century New York Mohican setting. Local historian Grace Greylock Niles, author of <i>The Hoosac Valley, its Legends and its History</i> (1912), imagined all of the Native peoples of New England to be members of what she called the "Abenakis Democracy," led by "kings and councilors" who were centered in the Hudson and Housatonic valleys. This theory ignores the clear distinctions among northeastern Native leaders, the delicacies of inter-tribal alliances, the political autonomy of Abenaki and Mohican peoples, and the differences in their histories after European invasion. Many sources on the world wide web today make similar mistakes.</p>
<a name="6"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 6</p>
<p class="bigbody">In 1637, after the Pequot War, a group of Native refugees settled a new community, called Schaghticoke, in northwestern Connecticut along the Housatonic River. During the 1700s, approximately 600 Native people from Mohican, Oweantinock, Pequot, Pootatuck, and Tunxis communities were permanently settled at Schaghticoke. led by sachem Gideon Mauwee. The Schaghticoke Tribe has long been recognized by the colony of Connecticut as a distinct political group. Today, the tribe is based on a 400 acre reservation of rocky, mountainous land in Kent, Connecticut. See "Schaghticoke Tribal Nation: Tribal History" on-line at: http://www.schaghticoke.com/index.php?page=history.historical.</p>
<a name="7"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 7</p>
<p class="bigbody">Mohican origin stories record that the Mohican people did not originate in New York, but migrated there from the west. The 18th century sachem Hendrick Aupaumet recounted:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">Our forefathers asserted, that their ancestors were emigrated from west by north of another country; they passed over the great waters, where this and the other country is nearly connected...that they lived by side of great water or sea, from whence they derive the name of Muhheakunnuck nation...As they were coming from the west, they found many waters, but none of them flowing and ebbing like Muhheakunnuck until they came to Hudson's River; then they said to one another, this is like Muhheakunnuck our nativity.</blockquote>
<p class="bigbody">From John Heckewelder <i>History, Manners and Customs of the Indian Nations</i> (1819), Philadelphia, PA:Arno Press reprint 1971, p. 108.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Many scholars call these people "Mahican," as an anglicized version of "Muhheakunnuck," but the tribal descendants living in Wisconsin today are officially known as the "Stockbridge Munsee Band of Mohican Indians" (see http://www.mohican.com/history/oeh.htm). For a more complete discussion of Mohican history, see Shirley Dunn, <i>The Mohican World 1680-1750</i>. Fleishmanns, NY: Purple Mountain Press 2000.</p>
<a name="8"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 8</p>
<p class="bigbody">Archaeological finds suggest that the lands around Schaghticoke, New York, were inhabited by Native people for millenia. In 1613, the Dutch explorer Adriaen Block was the first to call the indigenous peoples living along what is now the "Hudson River" "Mahicans." After 1676,  Albany court recorders and New York colonial leaders went to great lengths to distinguish between the Mohican, often called "River Indians," who were well-known as the indigenous inhabitants of the Hudson River Valley, and the Schaghticoke, who were the refugee newcomers.</p>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 9</p>
<p class="bigbody">The early colonial records are full of references to the speed and ease with which Algonkian peoples relocated entire villages of wigwams. For a fuller explanation of how this movement led to the mistaken impression that these homesites were temporary, see Elizabeth Chilton, "Towns They Have None: Diverse Subsistence and Settlement Strategies in Native New England," pp. 289-300 in J.

<p class="bigbody">For a discussion of the background and details of John Pynchon's negotiations between the Pocumtuck and Mohawk, see Margaret Bruchac and Peter Thomas, "Locating Wissatinnewag: John Pynchon's Influence on Pocumtuck Diplomacy," forthcoming in the <i>Historical Journal of Massachusetts</i>, Westfield, Massachusetts 2006. The clearest example of Pynchon's attempt to broker peace is a letter written July 28, 1663, to the Dutch at Fort Orange (Albany), on behalf of the Connecticut River Valley Indians and Mohican people of the Housatonic Valley, with whom Pynchon was engaged in fur trade:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">This is written to your Honors at the request of the Indians of Agawam, Pajassuck, Nalwetog [Nonotuck], Pocumtuck, and the Wissatinnewag [Housatonic], to inform their friends, the Dutch, that they are very much put out, because the Sowquackick [Sokoki] Indians had killed and murdered some of the Maquaas [Mohawk]; all the above named Indians request herewith that the Dutch Commissaries [at Fort Orange, now Albany] will believe, that only Sowquackick Indians had been killing the Maquaas. As to the other Indians of the Caneticot [Connecticut] River...they deplore it exceedingly, repudiate the deed, and... are resolved to keep up their intercourse and friendship with the Maquaas as before (NYCD XIII:308-309).</blockquote>
<p class="bigbody">The Mohawk responded to this message by attacking the Sokoki fort at present-day Hinsdale, New Hampshire that fall. By May of 1664, the records of a Dutch Court session at Fort Orange show the eagerness of the Mohawk to seek peace:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">Whereas the savages, called Maquaas, have very urgently requested, that we should [endeavor to make peace between that] tribe [the Pocumtuck] and the said Maquaas [and send some] Mahicanders to the Northern savages, called Onconntehocks [Sokokis] , to procure the release of the Maquaas, who have been captured by the said savages, and to assist them in every thing and do what the circumstances shall require to conclude a peace. (NYCD XIII:378) </blockquote>
<p class="bigbody">On May 19, 1664, Jan Dareth and Jacob Lockermans, accompanied by three Mohawk and three Mohican, left Albany for a meeting with the Pocumtuck (NYCD XIII:380-382). During this meeting, held at the Pocumtuck fort, three of John Pynchon's fur traders,  David Wilton, Henry Clark and Joseph Parsons, delivered a message that if any further trouble occurred, the colonists would force the Pocumtuck to leave the valley.  The Mohawk emissaries left and agreed to return with a gift of wampum. In June of 1664, however, the proposed peace between Mohawk and Pocumtuck fell apart when the Mohawk sachem Saheda and other ambassadors were murdered on their way to the Pocumtuck village.</p>
<a name="11"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 11</p>
<p class="bigbody">Three months after the murder of the Mohawk sachem Saheda, the new treaty signed by New York on September 24, 1664 promised:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">1. That the English do not assist the three Nations of the Ondiakes [Sokoki], Pinnehooks [Pennacook], and Pacamtohookes [Pocumtuck], who murdered one of the Princes of the Maquaas, when he brought ransomes &amp; presents to them upon a treaty of peace.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="bigbody">2. That the English do make peace for the Indian Princes, with the Nations [Mohican, Wappinger, Munsee, etc.] down the [Hudson] River.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="bigbody">3. That they may have free trade, as formerly.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="bigbody">4. That they may be lodged in houses, as formerly.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="bigbody">5. That if they be beaten by the three Nations above menconed, they may receive accomodacon from ye English (NYCD III:67-68)</blockquote>
<p class="bigbody">A Mohawk man named Cajadogo blamed the English for Saheda's death, but the Mohawk attacked the Pocumtuck fort regardless, in February of 1665 (NYCD XIII: 389). It's difficult at this distance to prove English guilt, but it's clear that the English benefitted from the damage, and the death of the Pocumtuck sachem Onapequin. Pynchon was only able to secure deeds to Pocumtuck lands after the Mohawk attack. This series of events, like other conflicts across New England, left lingering resentments that led to the outbreak of King Philip's War.</p>
<a name="12"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 12</p>
<p class="bigbody">A letter sent from John Pynchon to Massachusetts Governor John Winthrop Jr., April 9, 1674, reads, in part, as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">Our Indians at Woronoco and Pojassick are generally all of them removed to Albany; what the matter is they make so universal and general a move I know not. Some few Indians that stay do not like it and wish they have not gone hard with the Mohawks.</blockquote>
<p class="bigbody">(See Carl Bridenbaugh. <i>The Pynchon Papers, Volume I, Letters of John Pynchon, 1654-1700</i>, Boston, MA: Colonial Society of Masachusetts 1982, p. 124.)</p>
<p class="bigbody">This move may have been provoked by English settlers from Connecticut who were then forcing their way into Woronoco territory. Regional Native relations were also harmed by the recent prosecution and death of the Nonotuck sachem Chickwalloppe's son for a murder committed by another Native man.</p>
<a name="13"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 13</p>
<p class="bigbody"> In a September 8, 1675 letter to the English authorities at Albany, Pynchon recalled the 1664 peace treaty with the Mohawk against the Pocumtuck when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">I hope the engaging the Maquas not to entertain or favor our enemies may be of good use; truly their rage against us increases greatly. Since my last the Northampton and Hadley Indians have also shown themselves, and have killed seven of our men and wounded several...And unless the Maquas should manage their old quarrel against them, I doubt whether they may not at last show their rage against yourselves...</blockquote>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 17</p>
<p class="bigbody">Like similar sites along the Connecticut River, a region near the Hudson River was also known by the name of Pachog or Paquoag, meaning "flat, cleared ground." A letter sent from John Pynchon to Governor John Leverett, August 26, 1676, reads, in part, as follows: </p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">Some friends of Hadley and Northampton being with me this day, it hath been a metter of consideration whether the calling of all the garrison soldiers out of these towns may not expose them to the rage of the enemy who we certainly understand are gathered together at Paquoag on Hudson River about 200 men and having there their wives and children in a safe and secure place; the men may with freedom and without a clog make inroads upon these towns, doing what they do at a push, and suddenly return again to their headquarters; especially should they understand the soldiers are all drawn off hence, they may be more resolved and desperate, and we know not on what design the Indians are drawn off thither; we have no security that it is to withdraw from further persecution of the war, but rather that it is only to secure themselves, who, being engaged, will design revenge upon us.</blockquote>

<p class="bigbody">In the same month, a Native man named Menowniett reported to the English authorities at Hartford as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">He sayeth that the Norwottach [Nonotuck], Springfield Indians, and others are gon to a place about Hudson's River called Paquayag, and were encouraged to come there by a great man of those parts, whoe hath also encouraged them to engage against the English...He was askt where they had ye ammunition to carry on the war; he said the Powquiag Indians bought it of ye Dutch and sold it ym. He was askt how many of the North Indians [Sokoki] went that way. He sayth, "About 90 men of them and Sucquance [Soquans] is wth them, he was very sick and as like to die as live...He sayth ye Indians hid a great many gunns about Pacompuck, ye place he described to Tota.</blockquote>

<p class="bigbody">The colonial leaders in eastern Massachusetts enlisted John Pynchon to deliver a speech to the Mohawks at Albany, on November 9, 1683:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">I am sent from the government of Massachusetts to you, the Maquas [Mohawk], including your neighbors; and have undertaken this far journey in a difficult season to visit you and your friends, that there may be a right understanding between us for the continuance of amity and friendliness...for we did expressly conclude with you that you should not molest or injure our friend and neighbor Indians, nor were you to come at the Christian Indians [Nipmuc at Natick] that live near us and in friendship with us. </blockquote>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 20</p>
<p class="bigbody">John Pynchon seems to have been caught by surprise by this return of Pocumtuck people carrying passes of safe conduct from the Mayor of Albany. Samuel Partridge reported:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">...the Indians that are come down are about 150 of them, men, women, and children, and are settled at Deerfield under the side of the mountain southerly from the town, living in the woods about a mile out of the town, the men plying hunting and leaving their women and children at home. (Partridge, quoted by Pynchon in writing to Massachusetts Governor Simon Bradstreet, December 2, 1691.</blockquote>
<p class="bigbody">John Pynchon was well known to these Indians from his decades of trading furs, serving as a judge, fighting in King Philip's War, and now, reporting to the governors of the New England colonies. Pynchon wrote a set of directions for Partridge to deliver to the Pocumtuck, including the following:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">...we shall for the present overlook your seeming intruding upon us, and allow you abiding where you are this winter time, you behaving yourselves peacably and orderly and carrying it well to all our people...We do particularly caution you to beware of strong drink...We let you know that we are now apprehensive of some approach of the French and Indian enemy and therefore intend to keep out scouts, and to have more strict watch, and shortly to settle some more soldiers at Deerfield, wherefore none of you...are to go or wander from your present stations without orders in writing...</blockquote>
<p class="bigbody">The Pocumtuck, who apparently hoped for a more welcoming response, replied that they:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">...intend no ill to the English but to carry it peaceably...They desire their squaws may be safe under protection while they are all hunting.</blockquote>
<p class="bigbody">(See Carl Bridenbaugh. <i>The Pynchon Papers, Volume I, Letters of John Pynchon, 1654-1700</i>, Boston, MA: Colonial Society of Massachusetts 1982, p. 236-245.)</p>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 21</p>
<p class="bigbody">Chepasson seems to have taunted the English by boasting of his recent participation in Saint Francis Abenaki attacks on Dover, New Hampshire and Schenectady, New York. John Pynchon described this incident in a letter to Robert Treat, written from Springfield on June 19, 1690, transcribed in the <i>Judd Manuscripts Miscellaneous</i>, Volume 8:219-224, Forbes Library, Northampton, Massachusetts. For a description of the various events contributing to this incident, see Evan Haefeli and Kevin Sweeney, <i>Captors and Captives: The 1704 French and Indian Raid on Deerfield</i>, p. 29-30. </p>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 22</p>
<p class="bigbody">In 1696, a young man named Pemaquansett, who was apparently a relative of the Nonotuck sachem Umpanchela, was out hunting with three other Native men near Kunckwatchu (Mount Toby) when they discovered Richard Church of Hadley, hunting in what they still considered Indian land. Mahqualos and Mahweness were initially reported to have killed and scalped the Englishman; Wenepuck and Pemaquansett fled the scene. All four Native men were arrested, interrogated, and tried in the Northampton Court. After Indians from Hatfield testified, it was agreed that the two older men, Mahqualos and Mahweness, should be put to death for Church's murder. They were executed on October 23, 1696, but in May of 1697, Soquons, the Pocumtuck sachem at the refugee village of Schaghticoke, testified that a different man altogether had confessed to the murder. As a compromise, the Massachusetts General Court released the two younger men, Wenepuck and Pemaquansett. This event only led to more distrust and hostilities. (See James Spady. "As If In a Great Darkness: Native American Refugees of the Middle Connecticut River Valley in the Aftermath of King Philip's War," <i>Historical Journal of Massachusetts</i>, Vol. XXIII, No. 2, p. 183-197, Summer 1995.)</p>
<a name="23"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 23</p>
<p class="bigbody">On July 6, 1698, John Pynchon and Samuel Partridge posted a letter from Northampton to the Earle of Bellomont in London, England, complaining that:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">Those Indians have plainly declared themselves to be a body of thieves and murderers. If at any time they have given assistance to us, and been instrumental to destroy our enemies, it had not been out of any principle of friendship or obedience, for at other times they have been ready to assist our adversaries and destroy us. It is indifferent to them to destroy other English, so they run ganie their prey, and satisfy their bloodthirsty spirit. Sometimes they dwell at Stratburk [Schaghticoke], sometimes at the eastward and make marriages with the Eastern Indians [Eastern Abenaki, Pennacook, Pequawket, etc.], and sometimes at Canada [Saint Francis Abenaki], and live like beasts and birds of prey upon the destruction of others.</blockquote>

<p class="bigbody">The depiction of northern New England as "wilderness" was a romantic device in writing about unfamiliar territory that did not look like the carefully groomed landscape of Europe. In fact, New England consisted of much land that had been managed by human intervention over long spans of time, including burning of the forest undergrowth to eliminate brush and encourage new browse and berry plants, hunting and fishing in specific areas, and selective harvesting of various medicinal plants.

<p class="bigbody">The negotiations for the Kayaderossera patent in present-day Saratoga County were settled in 1768 with a payment of $5,000 to the Mohawk to "relinquish their claims to their old favorite hunting grounds." Title to the land was requested by Robert Livingston Jr. and David Schuyler in 1693, granted in an August 26, 1702 Indian deed, and then disputed by Sampson Shelton Broughton, whose widow took the original Indian deed with her when she returned to England. Thirteen claimants, most of them Dutch, had requested a warrant for the same lands through Viscount Cornbury in 1701, and their patent was secured in 1708. In 1764, the first settlers were driven off by the Mohawks, who pushed Sir William Johnson to appeal the claim on their behalf. The Abenaki protested Johnson's involvement in the matter, but Governor Sir Henry Moore finally settled the claim to title with the lump sum payment to the Mohawk in 1768 for what was actually Mohican land (Sylvester 1878:73-75). The Schaghticoke refugees apparently had a hand in the agreement, since Sir William Johnson went to some effort to distinguish their homelands from both Mohican and Mohawk claims: </p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">...the Mohocks do acknowledge the title of the Scarticook [Schaghticoke] Indians to the east of our bounds, and we the Mohocks and Stockbridge [Mohican] Indians do declare the foregoing bounds to be just and true (Sir William Johnson Papers 12:603-4, cited in Dunn 1994:58-59). </blockquote>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 39</p>
<p class="bigbody">While Colonel Samuel Partridge was sending wampum belts to the  Kahnawake seeking peace in 1723, Captain Benjamin Wright proposed  a different solution to end Gray Lock's War, offering to muster a party  to attack the W&ocirc;banakiak by way of Otter Creek: "We are desirous we  might go upon the wages the Province allows and the encouragement  they give to such for scalps." A Massachusetts legislative committee  considered the matter, and proposed:</p>
<p class="bigbody">...that an expedition to St. Francis, the headquarters of the Indians, would  be of great service, and may if prospered put an end to the present war:  400 able bodied men, English and Indians might be thought sufficient.  A smaller party to the heads of the rivers may be of service to destroy  some small hunting parties of the enemy.</p>

<p class="bigbody">Although scalping was practiced by both Native and non-Native people,  the bounty paid by Boston authorities became a strong incentive for  English colonists to attack the W&ocirc;banakiak. For example, Hannah Dustin,  taken captive from Haverill, Massachusetts in 1697, earned 50 pounds  for the Abenaki people ? one man, two women and six children ? she  personally scalped.</p>
<p class="bigbody">On June 10, 1756, the price paid for W&ocirc;banaki scalps, and the threat to  all Native people living north of Massachusetts, increased dramatically  when a new proclamation from the English king was passed by the  House of Representatives in Boston as follows:</p>
<p class="bigbody">Whereas the tribe of Penobscot Indians have repeatedly in a perfidious  manner acted contrary to their solemn submission unto his Majesty long  since made and ferequently renewed.</p>
<p class="bigbody">I have therefore, at the desire of the House of Representives...thought fit  to issue this Proclamation and to declare the Penobscot Tribe of Indians  to be enemies, rebels and traitors to his Majesty...And I do hereby require  his Majesty's subjects of the province [of Massachusetts] to embrace all  opportunities of pursuing, captivating, killing and destroying all and every  of the assorted Indians.</p>
<p class="bigbody">And whereas the General Court of this Province have voted that  bounty...  be granted and allowed to be paid out of the Province Treasury...the  premiums of bounty following viz.:</p>
<p class="bigbody"> For every scalp of a male Indian brought in as evidence of their being  killed as aforesaid, forty pounds.</p>
<p class="bigbody">For every scalp of a female Indian or male Indian under the age of twelve  years that shall be killed and brought in as evidence of their being killed  as aforesaid, twenty pounds...</p>
<p class="bigbody">Also voted, that the same allowance be made to private persons who shall...  kill any Indian enemy which is made to soldiers on the frontiers of the province.</p>

<p class="bigbody">In 1726, about 40 Penobscots attended a conference to request the removal of English houses recently built at Richmond and St. George, but the English refused. Much to the annoyance of the English, no other tribes had accepted Governor Dummer's invitation to ratify the peace made in Boston in 1725. When the Penobscot suggested that the conference should have been held at Montreal, the governor declared that it was beneath the dignity of the English to meet with Indians on French soil. The conference proceedings were published under the title <i>The Conference With the Eastern Indians, at the Ratification of the PEACE, held at Falmouth in Casco Bay, in July and August 1726</i>, Boston: American Antiquarian Society 1726.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Dummer had better success at a 1727 conference with the Penobscot, Pequawket, Norridewock and Wawenock, held at Falmouth. An earlier treaty, dated Boston, 15th December, 1725, which attempted to settle disputes over land and captives, was read and agreed to by four sachems whose totems were affixed to it. Several Pequawket Indians, including a young girl, Molly Ockett, who would later grow up to become a famous Indian Doctress, were sent to live at Plymouth, Massachusetts, to ensure the peace among these Indians and Massachusetts colony. The conference proceedings were published under the title <i>The Conference With the Eastern Indians at the further Ratification of the PEACE, Held at Falmouth in Casco-bay, in July 1727</i>, Boston: American Antiquarian Society 1726.</p>
<a name="41"></a>
<p class="subHead">Footnote # 41</p>
<p class="bigbody">In July of 1732, another conference was held by Dummer's successor, Jonathan Belcher, who met with the sachems Edawakenk and Loron (also called Laurent) of Penobscot, Toxus of Norridgewock, Adiawando (Atecouando) of Pequawket, and Medaganesset of Amerescoggin (Androscoggin) at Falmouth. The Native sachems demanded proper trading posts, security of hunting rights, and an end to English encroachments, but Belcher's chief business seemed to be to lecture the Indians against French religion and rum-drinking. Although peaceful relations were agreed upon, little other business was settled. The conference proceedings were published under the title <i>Conference Between Governor Belcher and Indians of the Penobscots, Norridgewocks, Pigwackets, and Amerescoggins at Falmouth and Casco Bay, July 1732</i>, Boston, American Antiquarian Society 1732.</p>

The manner in which the English chose to pursue diplomacy reveals a distinct anti-W&ocirc;banaki bias during this time period. In fact, Belcher tried to encourage the Kahnawake to move into Sokoki territory when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">The Cagnawaga, or those more especially call'd the French Mohawks have lately been to pay a visit to the Government by two of their Chiefs, who  we took care to entertain in th most Kind of friendly manner I possibly cou'd, and what they propos'd to me the Secretary will lay before you; They are a very considerable Nation of Indians, and I am of the opinion it will be much for our Interest &amp; Safety to cherish their motion of coming to settle in the Province between Otter Creek &amp; Fort Dummer</blockquote>

<p class="bigbody">The conference was originally scheduled to be held in Northampton, but the W&ocirc;banaki requested a change of venue, to Deerfield.

<p class="bigbody">This conference has been poorly understood, in large part due to errors made by Deerfield's town historian, George Sheldon, who published the proceedings in 1906. Sheldon misidentified all of the "Mohican" people at the conference as "Mohawk," and he was apparently unaware of, or unwilling to admit, that the "Schaghticoke" Indians were people who originally came from the Connecticut River Valley. </p>

<p class="bigbody">In 1735, Ebenezar Hinsdell, Joseph Kellogg, and others transacted four deeds for Sokoki lands in northern Massachusetts. On February 10, 1735, four Indians - Nechehoosqua, her husband Massequnt, and their children Aumesaucooanch and Tecaumis &#150; accepted "One Hundred Pounds in Bills of Credit" for lands lying "upon or by Connecticutt River to the north of Fort Dummer [Brattleboro, Vermont]" extending twenty miles on either side of the river. In correspondence leading up to the Deerfield conference, Governor Bcleher wrote to Kellogg on March 4, 1735:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">I take notice you and Mr. Hinsdell have purchased some land near your Fort [Fort Dummer], I hope you have not interfered with the Law of the Province ag[ain]st purchasing of the Indians (Belcher to Kellogg, MHSC March 4, 1735).</blockquote>
<p class="bigbody">In another deed, signed at Deerfield on August 29, 1735, four Schaghticoke Indians signed over a large tract of Wachusett territory  in what is now Athol, Barre, Dana, Gardner, Hubbardston, Orange, Petersham, Phillipston, Princeton, Rutland, Templeton and Westminster, MA. The signatories,"Francois Son of Nepuscauteusqua Dec[ease]d, and Ompontinnuwa, Penewanse, Cockiyouwah and Wallenas Sons to Woolauootaumesqua de[ceas]ed Sister to the Said Nepuscauteusqua," testified that they were "true owners of the Same and have in ourselves good right to sell" (Wright 1905:130). At a September confirmation hearing on the deed in Northampton, the signers also noted: "We do further declare to Our certain knowledge that no Indian or Indians of what name or nation Soever has any just right Challenge or interest to or in the abovesaid Tract of Land." (See Wright <i>Indan Deeds of Hampden County</i> 1905:120-133).</p>
<p class="bigbody">These transfers of land coincided with the movements of these same families north to Abenaki communities in Vermont and New Hampshire, or further north to the Abenaki mission village on the St. Lawrence, also called Odanak. Gordon Day sums up a portion of these relocations:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">By 1724 and perhaps before, some Schaghticokes who had originally come from the Connecticut Valley in Massachusetts joined the village of Missisquoi...In 1736 there were said to be 180 warriors (perhaps 900 persons) in Odanak  and Missisquoi together...In 1754 the last of the Schaghticoke village, then numbering 50 to 60 in all, moved to Odanak (Day 1981:64).</blockquote>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 46</p>
<p class="bigbody">Colonel John Stoddard oversaw the construction of Fort Dummer when it was established during Gray Lock's War. Jospeh Kellogg was in charge of scouts, and Timothy Dwight was the lieutenant in command. The Kanienkehaka sachem Hendrick served at the fort, as did the Mohican sachem Aupaumut, later joined by Massoqunt, Naunautoohoah, and Mascommah, Schaghticoke Indians who were present at the 1735 conference and had signed the 1735 deeds. The scouts typically served from spring to early winter, when they would return to their families for the winter hunting.

<p class="bigbody">English soldiers depended on these Indian scouts, but they also admitted that it was difficult to tell friend from foe. When the Schaghticoke Indians came to hunt in the region, they would inform the commanding officers of the towns of the signal that would identify them. One such signal was the wearing of green boughs on their heads, but this was not always reliable, as Colonel Samuel Partridge observed in a July 27, 1724 letter regarding the arrival of some Pequot allies to assist the English:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">They must have some signal, which must be known to our people, to prevent any evil that might otherwise happen...I have always directed all parties scouting from our parts of Hampshire Co. to observe your directions: but shall find it impracticable for them to be always safe. They may hide and seek as the Indians do, and your Indians will not always have the green bough upon their heads, sleeping as well as waking; and the sign may be stolen and used by the enemy as a decoy, and thus our men deceived to their hurt (Samuel Partridge in Josiah H. Temple, and George Sheldon. A History of the Town of Northfield, for 150 Years, with an account of the prior occupation of the territory of the Squakheags. Albany, NY: J.
