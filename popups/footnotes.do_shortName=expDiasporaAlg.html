<p class="bigbody">As just one example of a trading agreement, Christopher Levett wrote about his 1628 meeting at Boothbay Harbour with the sachems or sagamores Sadamoyt, Manawormet, Opparunwit (Runnawit), Shedragusset (Squidrayset), Cogawesco, Somerset (Samoset), and Conway (Passaconnaway), all representing the Almouchiquois or Central Abenaki: </p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">They asked me what I would do with my house, I told them I would leave ten of my men there until I came again, and that they should kill all the Tarrentens they should see (being enemies to them) and with whom the English have no commerce. At which they rejoiced exceedingly, and then spoke among themselves that when the time should be expired, which I spoke of for my return, every one at that place where he lived should look to the sea, and when they did see a ship they would send to all the sagamores in the country, and tell them that poor Levett was come again...</blockquote>

<blockquote class="bigbody">On the twenty-fourth of April [1650], the Sokouckiois arrives, bringing a message on the part of four villages,&mdash; to wit, of the Sokouckiois [Sokoki], of the Pagamptagwe [Pocumtuck], of the Penagouc [Pennacook], and of the Mahingans [Mohican], situated on the river of manate [Hudson River]; he answers the propositions that I had made to him by word of mouth, last autumn, the eighteenth of November. (The Abnaquiois [Abenakis], joining me, had made a present to the Sokouckiois, of fifteen [wampum] collars, and ten or twelve porcelain [wampum] bracelets, which might be valued at seven or eight bundles of Beaver skins,&mdash;in order to say to them: " Do what Onontio [the French governor] and tekwirimaeth tell you.") He said that those four villages, having held a Council during three months of the past winter, had resolved to take the risks against the Iroquois with Onontio and Noel, whether the English did or did not undertake the war against the Iroquois; and...they will oppose every other nation whatsoever that may wish to make war toward Quebecq...</blockquote>

<p class="bigbody">During the seventeenth century, the New England colonies often celebrated and set aside dates that marked victories over the Indians. After the massacre at the Pequot Fort, Massachusetts Bay Colony set aside October 12 as a day of "thanksgiving to God for subduing the Pequots."  The date of August 12, 1676, when Metacom was killed, was declared a formal "day of public thanksgiving" for the English victory." </p>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 13</p>
<p class="bigbody">James Labourie, Hugenot minister, wrote to Bellemont about the sudden departure of a group of Nipmuc Indians from what is now Oxford, Massachusetts:</p>
<blockquote class="bigbody">17 June 1700. The four Indians who returned here are departing to day for Penikook with 25 others whom they have persuaded, in spite of all my efforts, to accompany them. They gave as a reason that the inhabitants of New Roxbury continually annoyed them, and when I was not satisfied, they said that the religion of the Penikook Indians was more beautiful than ours, for the French gave them silver crosses to wear on their necks, and they added that there was another strong reason which they could not tell but would soon by known. </blockquote>

<p class="subHead">Footnote # 14</p>
<p class="bigbody">The Wabanaki Confederacy today includes two tribes of the Passamaquoddy Nation, one tribe of the Penobscot Nation, several tribes of the Malecite Nation, over 20 tribes of the Mi'kmaq or Micmac Nation, the Wolinak Abenaki, the Abenaki Nation and several other groups of Western Abenaki.</p>
<p class="bigbody">The Abenaki Nation includes the St. Francis Sokoki Band or Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi based in Swanton, VT, as well as the Abenaki Nation at Odanak, historically called the St. Francis, and now called the Odanak Band by the Canadian government. In Vermont, Western Abenaki applies to several historical and contemporary tribal groups, including the Sokoki or Sokwakiak from Brattleboro, VT to Northfield, MA, the Coos, Cowasuck or Cowassiak from Newbury to Lunenburg, VT, and the Nulheganook, Coaticook, and Kikomkwak of the Northeast Kingdom. The continuously inhabited village site along the Missisquoi River and the northeastern border of Lake Champlain,   is also identified in various historical records as Missisiak, Mazipskoik (in Abenaki) or Missisquoi (in French and English). </p>
