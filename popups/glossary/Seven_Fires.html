<br> 
This confederacy was a loose political organization of Algonkian and Iroquoian groups living along the St. Lawrence River who had diplomatic relationships with each other and who were allied to the French. These Nations were also allies of the Five Nations Iroquois Confederacy in New York state, but were not politically part of the Iroquois. The Seven Fires Confederacy included the Wendat (Huron) at Wendake, the Nipissing, and the St. Francis Wbanakiak (Abenaki), along with the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk) at Kanesetake, Kahnawake, and Akwesasne, and the Onondaga of Oswegatchie. It became more formalized following the English conquest of New France in 1760. This confederacy is also known as the "Seven Nations."
