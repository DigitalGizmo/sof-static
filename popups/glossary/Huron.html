<br> 
Huron is the name the French called the Wendats, a confederacy of northern Iroquoian people whose homeland is a peninsula in Georgian Bay of Lake Huron in present-day Ontario, Canada. The Wendats, meaning "island (or peninsula) dwellers," are also known as Wyandots. The Wendats (Huron) who joined the 1704 raid on Deerfield, were a group much reduced by epidemic and war with the Rotinonsionni (Iroquois Confederacy), who had moved from their homeland of Wendake to the mission village of Lorette near Quebec City. The Wendats (Huron) continue to live in the Quebec, Canada, town of Lorette, now called Wendake, and on reservations in Oklahoma, in the United States.</p>
