The word catholic is derived from the Greek word katholikos, meaning "universal" and hearkens back to the days when it was the sole Christian church. The Roman Catholic Church is believed by its members to be the only true inheritor, via the unbroken line of bishops (Popes) from St. Peter on down, of the authority given by Jesus Christ to his twelve apostles. Bitter religious conflict divided the Catholic Church in the 16th century, when Protestants broke away from the church to follow their own, alternative vision of a purer church. Although there were French Protestants, the country as a whole was considered a Catholic country and alternative religious practices were forbidden in New France. England and the bulk of its people, including those living in English colonial settlements like Deerfield, were in contrast, staunchly Protestant. </p><p><span class="small_menu"><SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">if (!isOpenedByNon1704) { // supress this link if page IS opened by outside link    document.write('<a href="javascript:window.close()">close window</a> |');}</SCRIPT><a href="javascript:window.print()">print</a></span></p></body></html>
