<br> 
The Algonkian word Woronoco or Worrinoke is a place name that indicates a river or lands that are turning about. The tribe called Woronoco was situated in present-day Westfield, Massachusetts, and was closely allied with the Agawam, Nonotuck and Pocumtuck. Culturally and linguistically, they are eastern Algonkian. During the 1730s, a Woronoco chief, Graylock, moved to Missisquoi, and became notorious for leading successful raids on English towns in the Connecticut River valley. His descendants, the Wawanolet and Nolet families at Odanak, take their name from his Native name, Wawanolewat, he who turns in his track. </p>
