<br> 
The Nine Years War is also known as King William's War in the North American English colonies, and elsewhere as the War of the League of Augsburg, the War of the Grand Alliance, the Orleans War, the War of the Palatinian Succession, or the War of the English Succession.  The war between the Grand Alliance and France began in 1689 and was fought (as the many names suggest) on fronts in several countries.  The Grand Alliance's central players were England, the Netherlands and Spain.  These countries, along with their respective colonies and Native allies, fought the French, their colonies and Native allies to halt French expansionism throughout Europe and abroad.  The Treaty of Rijswijk ended the war in 1697. In North America, this war marked the first of four so-called "French and Indian Wars."</p>
