The chief purpose of the league was coordination of defense and the settlement of boundary disputes; the internal affairs of each colony were to be left to its own management. With the revocation of the Massachusetts charter in 1684, the confederation was dissolved.  This union was also known as the “New England Confederation.”</p><p><span class="small_menu"><SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">if (!isOpenedByNon1704) { // supress this link if page IS opened by outside link    document.write('<a href="javascript:window.close()">close window</a> |');}</SCRIPT><a href="javascript:window.print()">print</a></span></p></body></html>
