<br> 
 A military body composed of civilians rather than soldiers. In both New France and New England, all adult males between the ages of 16 and 60 were expected to be part of the militia. Militia were called up periodically during time of war, both in response to threatened attacks and to launch attacks. Militiamen from surrounding communities were garrisoned in Deerfield at the time of the attack in 1704, and French militiamen were among the French attackers. </p>
