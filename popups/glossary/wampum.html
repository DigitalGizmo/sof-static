Wampum is a shortened version of the Algonkian word wampumpeage, meaning white shell bead. Traditionally, shell beads were two colors  white and dark purple, carved from periwinkles (Pyrula carica), and clams or quahaugs (Venus mercenaria). Dark purple wampum beads were called suckauhock, black shell. Wampum beads were used for personal adornment, trade, tribute, and ceremony. Shell beads were strung together or woven into belts that were used symbolically to mark treaties, send messages, and serve as mnemonics and marks of authority for speakers during councils and ceremonies. Wampum was also used, during the fur trade, by both Native peoples and Europeans, as a substitute for money.</p>
