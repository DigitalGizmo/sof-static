Most of the other officers and <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Militiamen.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Militiamen',''); return false">militiamen</a> who participated in the Deerfield raid were also from these settlements; it is likely that the officers hand-picked men from their communities who had the appropriate experience.

<p class="bigbody">Hertel de Rouville's father, Joseph-Fran&ccedil;ois Hertel de La Fresni&egrave;re, fought off Iroquois attacks on Trois-Rivi&egrave;res as a 15-year-old <a href="glossary.do_shortName=garrison.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Garrison',''); return false">garrison</a> soldier. In 1661, when he was 19, he was captured by the Iroquois. In the memoirs he wrote in his 70s, he says he was "wounded and made prisoner . . . and was about two years a slave among them. He is maimed in one hand by the bad treatment" he received, and "ran the risk of being burned alive." <a href="footnotes.do_shortName=Hertel.html" onclick="openLink(

He became a fur trader and interpreter, and participated in expeditions against the Iroquois in the 1660s and 1680s, distinguishing himself to such an extent that he was appointed commander of New France's Native allies.</p>
<p class="bigbody">The experience of fighting against the Iroquois developed the <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Canadiens.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Canadiens',''); return false">canadiens'</a> skills in <a href="glossary.do_shortName=partisan.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','partisan',''); return false">partisan</a> warfare as employed by Natives&mdash;to "march in snow shoes, carry and draw ammunition and stores so far, and storm a town in the very heart of the enemy's country," <a href="footnotes.do_shortName=Hertel.html" onclick="openLink(

Nobility, which was hereditary once granted, did not include financial rewards, but was a mark of high status and distinction. The Hertels and many of their fellow seigneurs and nobles were not wealthy; they depended on the modest production of their <a href="glossary.do_shortName=seigneuries.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','seigneuries',''); return false">seigneuries</a> and even more modest military salaries for income. Although Joseph-Fran&ccedil;ois Hertel was not, in fact, awarded his title for many years, the family acted like nobles: they took second names after their estates (e.g., "de Rouville," "de La Fresni&egrave;re"), used the title <i>e&ccedil;uyer</i> or "esquire," and married members of noble families.

<p class="bigbody">Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville followed in his father's footsteps, becoming an outstanding military leader with a knowledge of Native languages and lifeways. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1696, ahead of one of his older brothers. In addition to the attack on Salmon Falls and other expeditions, he had participated in an attack on the <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Seneca.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Seneca',''); return false">Senecas</a> in 1687.

<p class="bigbody">In August of 1703, de Rouville took part in an expedition to Maine that helped draw the W&ocirc;banakiak and <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Pennacook.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Pennacook',''); return false">Pennacooks</a> there into the latest war between France and England (<a href="glossary.do_shortName=Spanish_Succession.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Spanish_Succession',''); return false">War of the Spanish Succession</a>), laying the groundwork for the attack on Deerfield. A few months earlier, the English had killed a <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Penobscot.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Penobscot',''); return false">Penobscot</a> relative of a French nobleman who had married a woman of that nation. The Penobscots appealed to the alliance of Native communities along the Saint Lawrence River for help, and the French governor was happy to join in the response&mdash;an attack on the English in Maine. Hertel de Rouville was among 20 or 30 troupes accompanying 200 <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> (Mohawk) and W&ocirc;banakiak warriors to Maine. When they arrived, the Penobscots told them that they had already settled the matter with the English, in a council held at <a href="../maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'northeast',
        ''); return false">Casco, Maine</a> in June. But the Kanienkehaka said it was too late: they had come, and if the Penobscot didn't fight with them against the English, they would attack the Penobscot themselves. Together, they raided English settlements in Maine, and English reprisals brought the Wobanakiak fully into the war.</p>
<p class="bigbody">These developments were part of the French strategy of keeping the English and Natives as "irreconcilable enemies," in the words of New France's Governor Vaudreuil. New France, whose population and military resources were much smaller than those of New England, needed its Native allies. The fur trade between Natives and the French had diminished during the 1690s due to oversupply. The French feared that Natives would form trade&mdash;and therefore military&mdash;alliances with the English unless animosities between the two were kept fresh. The expedition against Deerfield was the next step in this unfolding strategy. The Pennacooks, responding to English attacks on Pennacook settlements in Maine and New Hampshire, asked Governor Vaudreuil in the fall of 1703 to join them in an attack of retribution against the English. He readily agreed, and leadership of the raid was given to Lieutenant Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville as his first independent command.</p>

<p class="bigbody">Hertel de Rouville's fellow officers were nobles or would-be nobles, like his family, and a mix of experienced fighters and young men. In fact, the group included three or four of his younger brothers: "most likely 29-year-old Ren&eacute; Hertel de Chambly, 27-year-old Lambert Hertel, 17-year-old Pierre Hertel de Moncours, and possibly 19-year-old Michel." <a href="footnotes.do_shortName=Hertel.html" onclick="openLink(

<p class="bigbody">Among the 50-odd Frenchmen in the expedition were also some enlisted men in the <i>troupes de la marine</i>, and militiamen from the officers' home villages who were probably experienced at fur trading and/or raids against Iroquois or English targets. The 200 Natives were from at least three nations and five villages, and, like the French, were a mix of experienced fighters and young men seeking to prove their skills.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Hertel de Rouville no doubt felt the enormity of the challenge he was taking on. His mission was to capture and destroy the English settlement of <a href="../maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'northeast',
        ''); return false">Deerfield</a>, and his success would be measured in numbers of enemy dead and property destroyed. He knew that Native fighters, while undoubtedly brave, would rather not attack fortified locations. They preferred smaller raids, and their goals were to take captives and avoid unnecessary casualties among their own forces. De Rouville also knew that it would be impossible to carry enough provisions for the trip back with captives, so hunger would be a problem. He would need all of his experience and skill to pull off this attack, but the rewards could be great: promotions, honors, and above all the granting of noble status to his family.</p>

A shot was fired&mdash;whether by the English watchman, one of his men, or an awakened villager he did not know, but it had the effect of sending the Native fighters scrambling for the first large houses they could reach. De Rouville knew that their first priority&mdash;especially that of the <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> (Mohawk)&mdash;was to take captives. Strategy was lost in the heat of battle as warriors of different nations competed for the spoils.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Hertel de Rouville was trying to rally some men to block the village's south gate against escape when Ensign Boucher called to him from a rough-looking shelter near the north gate. With surprise, De Rouville recognized the man they were tying up. It was Jacques de Noyon, a renegade fur trader who had been born within a year of De Rouville in his own village of <a href="../maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(

De Noyon was well known to De Rouville and his fellow officers for his adventures among the Natives far to the west. A defiant <a href="glossary.do_shortName=coureur_de_bois.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','coureur_de_bois',''); return false">coureur de bois</a>, he had last been heard of in New York, where he had treasonously offered to supply furs to the English. De Noyon and his two French companions were a coup for the expedition. Hertel de Rouville ordered his men to keep the three, as well as De Noyon's English wife and in-laws, as their own prisoners; the Native warriors were welcome to any others they could capture.</p>
<p class="bigbody">De Rouville surveyed the action. He could see that mixed groups of Kanienkehaka, <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Wendat.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wendat',''); return false">Wendat</a> (Huron), and <a href="glossary.do_shortName=Wobanakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakiak',''); return false">W&ocirc;banaki</a> fighters were attacking houses on the east and west sides of the village <a href="../maps/deerfield.html" onclick="openLink(

        ''); return false">common</a>, and that the residents were fighting back, firing from their windows. De Rouville saw a man take a bullet and fall halfway out of a window. Captives were being herded to the meetinghouse to be held under guard until the army was ready to leave. Flames and smoke were beginning to rise from houses and barns at the <a href="../maps/deerfield.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'Deerfield',
        ''); return false">south end</a> of the village.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Nearby, a large house was being assaulted. Ensign Margane de Batilly led a charge toward the house in a hail of small shot&mdash;and fell, badly wounded. De Rouville rallied another group of men to follow him, and rushed the house again. They succeeded only in dragging De Batilly beyond the range of the fire from the house. A group of Wendats charged the house with torches, but they too were driven back and their chief badly wounded. After repeated attacks and attempts to set the house afire, De Rouville called out to the resisting villagers and promised that they would not be harmed if they gave up their guns. He was answered with a volley of gunfire as <a href="people.do_shortName=BenoniStebbins.html" onclick="openLink(

        'BenoniStebbins',

<p class="bigbody">Angered, De Rouville led another assault, and this time it was he who fell with the shock of a hot bullet tearing into his arm. Cursing, he ordered his men to seek cover in the nearby meetinghouse and another large house (Ensign John Sheldon's) and shoot from those sheltered positions, keeping the occupants of the Stebbins house under constant fire.</p>
<p class="bigbody">De Rouville tied a rag around his arm and returned to the fight. He saw with satisfaction that many captives had been taken; a long line of them were being led out of the village by the Kanienkehaka. More than half the houses within the palisade were burning. Cattle, hogs, and sheep fleeing burning barns had been killed. The battle had been going on for nearly three hours, and De Rouville judged that his army had been successful in devastating the village.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Suddenly, one of the men on the second floor of the meetinghouse gave a shout, and Hertel de Rouville heard the sound of gunfire coming from the south. He knew it was probably English reinforcements. He called for Ensign Boucher, but finding him injured, told his brother Ren&eacute; and a small group of militiamen, W&ocirc;banakiak, and Wendats to cover the retreat as long as they could, then join him at the river. De Rouville had a plan against pursuit that he needed to set up, having chosen the south bank of the Deerfield River as a place from which to ambush pursuers.</p>

Anticipating pursuit by the English reinforcements who had ridden to Deerfield from neighboring towns, De Rouville had rallied his small group of men and had them lie in ambush along the south bank of the river. The English indeed chased the remaining raiders and their captives across the snowy meadow. De Rouville and his men could hear them coming, shouting and shooting. And then they could hear them floundering through the snow, hear the creak of their leather and their labored breathing. De Rouville gave the command, and his men stood up and fired a volley directly at the oncoming English. Several fell and the rest turned and ran, with De Rouville and his men in measured pursuit. They drove the English back to the town palisade, then retreated back across the meadows and river to the campsite.</p>
<p class="bigbody">The Natives had been preparing their captives for the march, giving them moccasins and organizing them. Hertel de Rouville allowed his men a brief rest and a drink, and had someone tend to his wound. It wasn't bad, just some small shot in the flesh. He was more concerned about Ensign Fran&ccedil;ois-Marie Margane de Batilly, who was unconscious and probably dying from his stomach wound.</p>
<p class="bigbody">As the ragged column began to move&mdash;Native warriors, Canadian officers and adventurers, and weeping English captives; everyone dirty or bloody, carrying burdens of gear, the wounded, or children&mdash;De Rouville considered the success of the raid. This was his first independent command, though he had fought in many similar battles. Indeed they had devastated the English town, burning more than half the houses and carrying off much loot. They had over a hundred captives, and he reckoned that another 50 or so English had been killed. By these measures, the attack was a success.</p>
<p class="bigbody">But the number of allies dead and wounded was unusually high. If everything had gone the way it had at <a href="../maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'northeast',
        ''); return false">Salmon Falls</a> or <a href="../maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'northeast',
        ''); return false">Schenectady</a>, only one or two of De Rouville's army would have died, and only a few would have been wounded. In fact, 22 Frenchmen had been wounded, including most of his officers&mdash;himself, one of his brothers, Ensign Boucher, Charles Legardeur de Croisille, and Ensign Margane de Batilly, who would surely die. Two more Frenchmen and eight or nine Natives had died, and more seemed likely to die of their wounds on the trail. De Rouville was angry that he had not exerted better control over the raiders as they entered the village.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Things were still more chaotic than he wanted. There were many captives to get back to New France, a <a href="../maps/march.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'march',
        ''); return false">long walk</a> through the ice and snow. Some of the Natives had several captives and others had none, and this could cause trouble among them. They were not able to put much distance between themselves and Deerfield before they had to make camp on the first day, and De Rouville was concerned that the English could easily overtake them.</p>
<p class="bigbody">That night, two disturbing things happened. One of the captives, a young man, escaped. And a group of Natives got drunk on rum they had looted in the raid and killed another captive, an <a href="people.do_shortName=Frank.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'Frank',
        'March'); return false">African man</a>. In the morning, De Rouville exerted his authority. He ordered <a href="people.do_shortName=JohnWilliams.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'JohnWilliams',
        'March'); return false">John Williams</a>, the English minister who seemed to be a leader among the captives, to tell his friends that the Natives would burn them all if any more escaped. De Rouville then appointed a front and rear guard, and spoke to his men of the need to move quickly. He reminded them that after the raid on Schenectady, the English had pursued the raiding party almost all the way back to Montreal, capturing stragglers to the last. If everyone focused on moving forward and keeping the prisoners moving as quickly as possible, that in itself would impose discipline on the diverse and independent-minded group of allies.</p>
<p class="bigbody">Although he left most of the individual captives in the Natives' hands, Hertel de Rouville was determined to get the army and the captives as a group back to New France. That would be the final proof of the raid's success, and his honor and that of the Hertel family name depended on it.</p>

</p>
<p class="bigbody">Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville was recommended for promotion for his success at leading the raid on Deerfield. Governor Vaudreuil wrote to the minister of the <i>marine</i>: "I had the honor to . . . inform you of the success of the party I sent this winter on the ice as far as the Boston government at the request of the Abenaki Indians whom the English attacked . . .  and took the liberty to speak to you of Sieur de Rouville who commanded on that occasion: he desires, my Lord, that you would have the goodness to think of him promotion . . . being still actually with the Abenakis. . . . Sieur de Rouville's party, my Lord, has accomplished everything expected of it, for independent of the capture of a fort, it showed the Abenakis that they could truly rely on our promises." <a href="footnotes.do_shortName=Hertel.html" onclick="openLink(
        'footnotes',
        'Hertel',
        '5'); return false">(5)</a> The governor also reiterated his support for letters of <a href="glossary.do_shortName=noble.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','noble',''); return false">nobility</a> for De Rouville's father, Joseph-Fran&ccedil;ois Hertel de La Fresni&egrave;re, citing the wound Hertel de Rouville received in the raid as a "mark of valor."</p>
<p class="bigbody">The Hertels did not receive the honors they hoped for as a direct result of the Deerfield raid, but Hertel de Rouville continued to serve king and colony throughout his life. He married for the second time in February of 1708, to Marie-Anne Baudouin, the daughter of a Quebec doctor. Later that year, Lieutenant de Rouville and Captain Deschaillons shared command of an unsuccessful expedition against Haverhill, Massachusetts, in which De Rouville's brother Ren&eacute; Hertel was killed. In 1709, De Rouville and another veteran of the 1704 Deerfield raid, Ren&eacute; Boucher, led another Native-initiated raid on Deerfield. Instead of an all-out attack on the Deerfield stockade, de Rouville's men captured two Deerfield residents and laid an ambush for others who rode out to find the attackers. In 1711, Governor Vaudreuil sent De Rouville and a friend to Boston, supposedly on a diplomatic mission but actually to gather intelligence.</p>

He died six months later, at the age of 54&mdash;a month after the death of his 80-year-old father, Joseph-Fran&ccedil;ois Hertel.</p>

<br>
<span class="bigbody"></span>
</p>
<p class="bigbody">Most of this narrative is factual, based on the research of Evan Haefeli and Kevin Sweeney as presented in their book <i>Captors and Captives: The 1704 French and Indian Raid on Deerfield</i> (Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 2003). The exception is some details of the raid and retreat, which, though based on facts, are imagined. For example, it is known that De Rouville was injured during the raid, but where and how he was injured is not known. Similarly, we know that the south gate of the palisade was not blocked against escape, but there is no evidence that De Rouville, as described herein, was ordering it to be done when he was distracted by the capture of Jacques de Noyon.
