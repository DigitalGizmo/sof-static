<p class="scene_title">The Attack on Deerfield</p>
<span class="segment_title">Intro</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Deerfield attacked:</span> On <a href="/popups/glossary/dates.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','dates',''); return false">February 29, 1704</a>, the sun rose on a chaotic scene in the English settlement of <a href="/maps/crv.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'crv',
        ''); return false">Deerfield</a>, Massachusetts. Bodies lay in the street. Houses had been plundered and set on fire. The Native and <a href="/popups/glossary/French.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','French',''); return false">French</a> allies claimed captives; many who resisted or seemed unable to survive the difficult <a href="/maps/march.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'march',
        ''); return false">trek north</a> were killed. By the time the forces withdrew, 41 <a href="/popups/glossary/English.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','English',''); return false">English</a> and six allies were dead.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Allied forces:</span> In Europe, France and England were fighting the <a href="/popups/glossary/Spanish_Succession.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Spanish_Succession',''); return false">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, a conflict that spilled over to the colonies. Nevertheless, each contingent of the allied raiding party had its own reasons for destroying this northwestern-most New England <a href="/maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'northeast',
        ''); return false">settlement</a>. The force consisted of 200 to 250 <a href="/popups/glossary/Wobanakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakiak',''); return false">W&ocirc;banakiak</a>, <a href="/popups/glossary/Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> (Mohawk), and <a href="/popups/glossary/Wendat.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wendat',''); return false">Wendat</a> (Huron) warriors and 48 French troops and <a href="/popups/glossary/Canadiens.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Canadiens',''); return false">canadiens</a>. Most of the raiders had traveled over 300 miles from Fort Chambly near Montreal through bitter winter weather&mdash;a trip that Natives and French were well prepared for, but which was logistically difficult given the size of the expedition. </p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Surprise:</span> In response to rumors of an allied French-Native attack, Deerfield's <a href="/popups/glossary/Palisade.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','palisade',''); return false">palisade</a> had been repaired and <a href="/popups/glossary/garrison_soldiers.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','garrison_soldiers',''); return false">garrison soldiers</a> arrived just days earlier. Yet the pre-dawn attack took the town by surprise. The allies' probable plan was to sneak into the settlement and surround each house, then attack simultaneously for maximum captives and minimum casualties to the raiding forces. But the element of surprise was lost when a gunshot woke the villagers before all of the allies were in place.</p>
<p>
<i>Was this dramatic pre-dawn raid in contested lands an unprovoked attack on an innocent civilian village, or a justified military action against a fortified settlement in Native homelands?</i>
</p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">Wobanakiak</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">In the battle: </span><a href="/popups/glossary/Wobanakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakiak',''); return false">W&ocirc;banaki</a> fighters split into groups with other Natives and French to attack individual houses. More than 20 Natives broke into the large home of <a href="/popups/people/JohnWilliams.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'JohnWilliams',
        'Attack'); return false">John Williams</a>, Deerfield's minister. As a person of status, Williams would command a large ransom, so three <a href="/popups/glossary/Wobanakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakiak',''); return false">W&ocirc;banakiak</a> took him captive. Guards held the surviving members of the Williams family in their house until the raiders were ready to withdraw. As they departed the settlement, the W&ocirc;banakiak joined other raiders in burning houses and killing livestock, devastating the village in order to discourage resettlement, and halt further incursions into <a href="/maps/home_wob.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'home_Wob',
        ''); return false">W&ocirc;banaki homelands</a>.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">At the beaver hill:</span> The village the English called "Deerfield" was situated in the heart of familiar W&ocirc;banaki territory. Beside the rivers called Pocumtuck and <a href="/popups/glossary/Connecticut_river.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Connecticut_river',''); return false">Quinneticook</a>, among the fertile fields below <a href="/popups/glossary/Pemawatchuwatunck.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Pemawatchuwatunck',''); return false">Pemawatchuwatunck</a>, generations of <a href="/popups/glossary/Pocumtuck.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Pocumtuck',''); return false">Pocumtuck</a> people had hunted, fished, set their wigwams and planted their corn. Deerfield sat at the crossroads of major east-west and north-south Native trails. W&ocirc;banaki people followed those trails, in company with their allies, to attack the village set in some of their former homelands.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Several groups of W&ocirc;banaki</span> people were in the war party. The largest was from <a href="/popups/glossary/St_Francis.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','St_Francis',''); return false">St. Francis</a>, a village near the St. Lawrence River that included Pocumtuck and other refugees from central and northern New England Native communities. W&ocirc;banaki peoples of <a href="/popups/glossary/missisquoi.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Missisquoi',''); return false">Missisquoi</a>, <a href="/popups/glossary/Cowass.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Cowass',''); return false">Cowass</a> and <a href="/popups/glossary/Sokwakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Sokwakiak',''); return false">Sokoki</a> in present-day Vermont joined in, as did the <a href="/popups/glossary/Pennacook.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Pennacook',''); return false">Pennacook</a>, a central W&ocirc;banaki people from the region now known as New Hampshire. The Pennacook, one of whose villages the English had recently attacked, had been fighting the English in New Hampshire and Maine.  They likely initiated this raid by urging their Native allies and the French to join them in an attack on New England.</p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">English</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Taken by surprise:</span>  "The enemy came in like a flood . . . and by their violent endeavors to break open doors and windows, with axes and hatchets, awaked me out of sleep. . . ." <a href="footnotes/Attack.html" onclick="openLink(
        'footnotes',
        'Attack',
        '1'); return false">(1)</a> Like <a href="/popups/people/JohnWilliams.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'JohnWilliams',
        'Attack'); return false">John Williams</a>, many families in the <a href="/maps/deerfield.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'deerfield',
        ''); return false">north part of town</a> were surprised and taken captive&mdash;except for the youngest, who were killed. Elsewhere within the <a href="/popups/glossary/Palisade.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','palisade',''); return false">palisade</a>, people roused by the noise had more time to attempt escape or to resist capture. Well-armed people in <a href="/popups/people/BenoniStebbins.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'BenoniStebbins',
        'Attack'); return false">Benoni Stebbins</a>'s house resisted for over two hours, killing several attackers and holding out until the Native and French forces retreated. The raiders devastated the town, burning 17 houses and barns full of tools, provisions, and livestock. </p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Between two empires:</span>  As a New England frontier town, Deerfield was on the edge of the English empire and on the border of W&ocirc;banaki-controlled territory. Frequent wars between the rival European powers extended into North America, where they fought for control of its rich resources&mdash;<a href="background/expLand.html" onclick="openLink(
        'background',
        'expLand',
        ''); return false">land</a> and furs. Deerfield's location near the Connecticut River made it especially vulnerable to attack by the French and their Native allies.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Warnings and preparations</span>:  Reports of a planned French-Native attack had circulated for months, and in October two Deerfield men were captured as they worked in the fields outside the palisade. In response, the palisade was repaired and people whose homes were outside built temporary shelters inside the "fort." But when nothing more happened and the cold and snowy winter of 1704 set in, Deerfield villagers let down their guard.</p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">French</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Plan falters:</span>  Lieutenant <a href="/popups/people/Hertel.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'Hertel',
        'Attack'); return false">Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville</a>, the official leader of the expedition, was seasoned in the ways of frontier warfare, but the raiding party was large and made up of warriors from independent nations. Discipline broke down, and fighting began before the raiders surrounded every house. The allies lost the advantage of surprise and suffered higher casualties than in similar raids, especially among the <a href="/popups/glossary/French.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','French',''); return false">French</a>. French troops and <a href="/popups/glossary/Canadiens.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Canadiens',''); return false">canadiens</a> fought alongside Native warriors in assaulting Deerfield homes.  Early in the raid, the French captured Jacques de Noyon and two other renegade French fur traders who had fled to New England in search of better economic opportunities.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">French goals:</span>  For De Rouville and his fellow officers, military success was a route to promotion, even <a href="/popups/glossary/noble.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','noble',''); return false">noble</a> status. It was his first independent command, though he had fought in many such raids under his father. For France, the raid helped confirm alliances with Native nations in an unstable time, and stirred up trouble between the <a href="/popups/glossary/English.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','English',''); return false">English</a> and Native groups. Embroiled in war with England, <a href="/popups/people/Vaudreuil.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'Vaudreuil',
        'Attack'); return false">Governor Vaudreuil</a> of <a href="/popups/glossary/New_France.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','New_France',''); return false">New France</a> had been planning to attack New England since the spring of 1703.  When the <a href="/popups/glossary/Pennacook.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Pennacook',''); return false">Pennacook</a> asked for his help against the English in the fall of 1703, Vaudreuil took the opportunity to deliberately include warriors from as many Native communities as possible in this attack, especially from among <a href="/popups/glossary/Iroquoian.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquoian',''); return false">Iroquoian</a> and <a href="/popups/glossary/Algonkian.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Algonkian',''); return false">Algonkian</a> peoples who participated in the French-brokered <a href="/popups/glossary/Great_Peace.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Great_Peace',''); return false">Great Peace of 1701</a>. </p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Victory:</span>  The raid was a great success for New France. It reinforced its alliances with Native groups, intensified the rift between the English and Native groups, spread fear throughout New England, and put the English on the defensive. </p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">KanienKehaka</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Raiders:</span>  Among the largest contingent of allies were <a href="/popups/glossary/Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> (Mohawk) from <a href="/popups/glossary/Kahnawake.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kahnawake',''); return false">Kahnawake</a> and other Iroquois warriors from <a href="/popups/glossary/Sault_au_Recollet.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Sault_au_Recollet',''); return false">Sault-au-R&eacute;collet</a> and <a href="/popups/glossary/La_Montagne.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','La_Montagne',''); return false">La Montagne</a>. They were among the group who broke into <a href="/popups/people/JohnWilliams.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'JohnWilliams',
        'Attack'); return false">John Williams</a>'s house and captured his family. They also were a part of the group who besieged <a href="artifacts/sheldonhouseptg.html" onclick="openLink(
        'artifacts',
        'sheldonhouseptg',
        ''); return false">Ensign John Sheldon's house</a>, the largest in town. A Kanienkehaka hacked at the reinforced <a href="artifacts/door.html" onclick="openLink(
        'artifacts',
        'door',
        ''); return false">front door</a> with an axe, but finally got in through a back door. The house became a holding place for captured villagers. The Kanienkehaka and other groups competed for captives and plunder. Because the Kanienkehaka valued captives above all, they moved their prisoners out before the fighting was over, burning houses north of the <a href="/popups/glossary/Palisade.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','palisade',''); return false">palisade</a> on their way. </p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">The bell:</span>  Kanienkehaka <a href="/popups/glossary/Oral_Tradition.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Oral_Tradition',''); return false">oral tradition</a> tells that in Deerfield the <a href="/maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'northeast',
        ''); return false">Kahnawake</a> raiders hoped to find a <a href="artifacts/bell.html" onclick="openLink(
        'artifacts',
        'bell',
        ''); return false">church bell</a> that had been purchased by the people of Kahnawake and transported on a French ship from Europe. According to this tradition, the bell was stolen en route by English privateers and later bought by John Williams. Such traditions expressed Catholic Kanienkehaka feelings of distrust and religious opposition toward the Protestant <a href="/popups/glossary/English.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','English',''); return false">English</a> colonists. </p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Why they fought:</span>  The Kanienkehaka had other reasons for joining the raid, the most important of which was to take captives. Traditionally, "<a href="/popups/glossary/mourning_war.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Mourning_War',''); return false">mourning wars</a>" were a way to console grieving families; adopting captives replaced loved ones who died naturally or in warfare. Since contact with Europeans, captives were also used for ransom. Other reasons for participating included their longtime interest in the Connecticut River Valley, their alliances with the <a href="/popups/glossary/French.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','French',''); return false">French</a> and the other Native villages, and the desire for goods like the muskets and blankets they brought back to Kahnawake for distribution.</p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">Wendat</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">The siege:</span> The <a href="/popups/glossary/Wendat.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wendat',''); return false">Wendats</a> (Huron) from the village of <a href="/popups/glossary/Lorette.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Lorette',''); return false">Lorette</a> sent the smallest contingent, about 20 warriors, to the Deerfield expedition. After taking houses elsewhere in the village, Wendat fighters besieged <a href="/popups/people/BenoniStebbins.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'BenoniStebbins',
        'Attack'); return false">Benoni Stebbins</a>'s house along with <a href="/popups/glossary/Wobanakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakiak',''); return false">W&ocirc;banakiak</a> and French troops. They traded gunfire for over two hours with the well-armed villagers inside the brick-insulated building. One of their great chiefs, Tsawenhohi, was mortally wounded leading a charge against the house; he was one of more than 30 allies killed or wounded in the raid. The Stebbins house defenders held out against repeated assaults and attempts to set the house afire.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Alliance is all:</span> As a small community, the Wendats valued alliance and trade highly. The <a href="/popups/glossary/French.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','French',''); return false">French</a> considered them their closest Native allies&mdash;as well as crafters of especially fine <a href="artifacts/snowshoes.html" onclick="openLink(
        'artifacts',
        'snowshoes',
        ''); return false">snowshoes</a>, for which they placed a large order before the raid. The Wendat's complex alliances included close ties with the <a href="/popups/glossary/Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> (Mohawk) and the <a href="/popups/glossary/Wobanakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakiak',''); return false">W&ocirc;banakiak</a>, who likely first asked the village of <a href="/maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'northeast',
        ''); return false">Kahnawake</a>, and then the Wendat and the French, for help against the English. The Wendats were eager to participate in support of their allies; unlike the other groups, they did not have a special interest in Deerfield. They did hope to obtain captives for adoption or revenge, in the <a href="/popups/glossary/mourning_war.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Mourning_War',''); return false">mourning-war</a> tradition.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Wendat warriors:</span> The Wendats proved their mettle in the attack and during the retreat from Deerfield. With W&ocirc;banaki and French fighters, they ambushed and routed the English pursuers, so that the allies and their captives could get away. As a small group participating in the raid, the Wendat served as scouts and provided cover for larger groups of French and Native allies.</p>
