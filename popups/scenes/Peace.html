<p class="scene_title">The Great Peace of 1701</p>
<span class="segment_title">Intro</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">An international gathering:</span> In August 1701, French officials and delegates from 40 Native groups gathered <a href="/popups/glossary/Montreal.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Montreal',''); return false"></a>to conclude a radical, far-reaching peace treaty. Flotillas of canoes from the Great Lakes region across <a href="/popups/glossary/iroquoia.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquoia',''); return false">Iroquoia</a> traveled up the St. Lawrence River toward <a href="/maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'northeast',
        ''); return false">Montreal</a>, while other delegates journeyed in from <a href="/popups/glossary/Wobanakia.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakia',''); return false"></a><a href="/maps/home_wob.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'home_wob',
        ''); return false">W&ocirc;banakia</a> in the east. In all, some 1,300 representatives converged on this small French town where they were greeted by the Governor of <a href="/popups/glossary/New_France.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','New_France',''); return false">New France</a>. For two weeks, participants exchanged gifts, traded goods, and feasted against the backdrop of delicate and complex negotiations.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Treaty goals:</span> The goal of this ambitious gathering was to establish a general peace among the participating groups. Other crucial terms included shared access to northern hunting grounds and an agreement to stay neutral or support the French in disputes with the English.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Different motivations:</span> Each group had different reasons for supporting a general peace. The French wanted the <a href="/popups/glossary/iroquois.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquois',''); return false">Iroquois</a>, politically allied with the English, to become a neutral buffer between the English colony of New York and New France. The Iroquois had suffered heavy losses from attacks by French and their Native allies. Unable to count on English assistance, they reluctantly made concessions for peace. Concerns among France's Native allies that the French might undercut their trading relationship by concluding a separate peace with the Iroquois, made them willing to negotiate.</p>
<p>How did this peace agreement impact future conflicts between the French and English?</p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">French</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Treaty goals:</span> Months of diplomatic overtures bore fruit when <a href="/popups/people/Calliere.html" onclick="openLink(
        'people',
        'Calliere',
        ''); return false">Governor de Calli&egrave;re</a> of <a href="/maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'northeast',
        ''); return false">New France</a> convened his Native allies and the <a href="/popups/glossary/iroquois.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquois',''); return false">Iroquois Confederacy</a> in the summer of 1701. This brilliant diplomatic move would, he hoped, produce a treaty assuring New France's safety and prosperity. The French anticipated renewed hostilities with England; Iroquois alliance&mdash;or at the very least, neutrality&mdash;was an important diplomatic and strategic goal for de Calli&egrave;re. Additionally, the French sought to prevent the English&mdash;who viewed the Iroquois as subjects&mdash;from claiming Iroquois territory.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">A dominant power:</span> French interests in the west centered on the fur trade. Maintaining Native alliances was crucial to sustaining that trade. The French accomplished this by promising assistance in wars against the Iroquois, even as they encouraged war among these peoples. This strategy kept the French allies from uniting with the Iroquois against the French and from trading with France's English rivals in Albany. By the second half of the 1600s, the French and their allies wore down the Iroquois by burning villages and destroying food supplies, thus rendering New France a dominant power, able to call the Iroquois into peace with itself and its Native allies.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Unexpected consequence:</span> The Great Peace initiated a new alliance between the Iroquois and western Native people, opening the door for France's Native allies to trade and possibly make alliances with the English at Albany. This unexpected consequence of the peace undercut France's military, political and economic alliances with western peoples and weakened the allies' need for the French. Thus, the French focused their allies' attention on their common mutual enemy, turning to New England&mdash;and Deerfield in 1704&mdash;as a convenient and strategic target.</p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">Wendat</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Noteworthy absence:</span> The <a href="/popups/glossary/Wendat.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wendat',''); return false">Wendat</a> (Huron) <a href="/popups/glossary/Huron.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Huron',''); return false"></a><a href="/popups/glossary/Huron.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Huron',''); return false"></a>from <a href="/popups/glossary/Lorette.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Lorette',''); return false">Lorette</a> were surprisingly absent from the Great Peace event. In the past, they had taken part in negotiations with the <a href="/popups/glossary/iroquois.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquois',''); return false">Iroquois Confederacy</a>, along with the <a href="/popups/glossary/Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> (Mohawk) of <a href="/popups/glossary/Kahnawake.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kahnawake',''); return false">Kahnawake</a> and <a href="/popups/glossary/La_Montagne.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','La_Montagne',''); return false">La Montagne</a> and the <a href="/popups/glossary/Wobanakiak.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanakiak',''); return false">W&ocirc;banakiak</a>, who were present at the Montreal peace negotiations. Their interests may have been represented by the chiefs of their allies at Kahnawake as part of the federation that became known as the <a href="/popups/glossary/Seven_Fires.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Seven_Fires',''); return false">Seven Fires Confederacy</a>, or by the other Wendat from the Great Lakes region who attended.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Committed to alliance:</span> The Wendat from the Great Lakes region were derived from the several hundred Wendat who fled west after their alliance with the French fragmented the Wendat confederacy, precipitating its fall to the Iroquois in 1649.  Still another group of about 300 had gone east to the Quebec area and at this time were known as the Lorrettans. Both groups nurtured close ties with each other and remained staunchly pro-French and committed to their alliances.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Treaty goals:</span> The benefit the Lorrettans' received in the peace negotiations was very much like that of other <a href="/maps/northeast.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'northeast',
        ''); return false">Native villages</a> in New France: less fighting. Renewed relations among former friends and family members taken captive and adopted into <a href="/popups/glossary/iroquois.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquois',''); return false">Iroquois</a> villages in the course of previous decades of warfare between the Wendat and the Iroquois, was another hoped-for outcome of a general peace.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Epidemic:</span> At the time of the Great Peace in Montreal, a deadly epidemic took many Native lives. Among those lost was the great Wendat chief from the west, Kondiaronk, after delivering what turned out to be a deathbed speech supporting the peace. Two days later the delegates signed the treaty.</p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">Wobanakiak</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Treaty goals:</span> The <a href="/popups/glossary/Nine_Years_War.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Nine_Years_War',''); return false">Nine Years War</a> ended for the French in 1697, but their <a href="/popups/glossary/Wobanaki.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Wobanaki',''); return false">W&ocirc;banaki</a><a href="/popups/glossary/Abenaki.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Abenaki',''); return false"></a> allies in New England continued fighting the English until 1699, due to continued English invasion of their <a href="/maps/home_wob.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'home_Wob',
        ''); return false">homelands</a>. From 1699-1702, both the French and English tried to negotiate with the W&ocirc;banaki and <a href="/popups/glossary/Pennacook.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Pennacook',''); return false">Pennacook</a> peoples to secure their alliance; the French were more successful. Years of conflict over English settlements expanding into their territories made W&ocirc;banaki groups in New England keen to strengthen their position against the English, and to begin re-establishing their traditional village sites on the <a href="/maps/crv.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'crv',
        ''); return false"></a><a href="/maps/crv.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'crv',
        ''); return false">middle Connecticut River</a>. They also joined in the Great Peace to ensure against further <a href="/popups/glossary/iroquois.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquois',''); return false">Iroquois</a> attacks.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Preparation:</span> In preparation for the peace negotiations, a large number of people gathered at Lake Winnipesaukee in the Pennacook <a href="/maps/home_wob.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'home_wob',
        ''); return false">homeland</a>. This group included members of what would eventually evolve into the <a href="/popups/glossary/Seven_Fires.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Seven_Fires',''); return false">Seven Fires Confederacy</a>, incorporating W&ocirc;banakiak from St. Francis and <a href="/popups/glossary/Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> (Mohawk) from Kahnawake, along with other Algonkian and Iroquoian peoples in the north.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Active ambassadors and allies:</span> In the years prior to the Great Peace, many W&ocirc;banakiak took periodic <a href="/maps/movements.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'movements',
        ''); return false">refuge from English</a> hostility in French mission villages. The W&ocirc;banakiak had joined the French and other northern Native peoples in resisting Iroquois incursions into W&ocirc;banakia. The W&ocirc;banakiak of St. Francis, however, eventually formed a lasting alliance with the Kanienkehaka of Kahnawake, and worked with them to negotiate directly with the Iroquois Confederacy. These proceedings led up to the final agreement signed at the Great Peace.</p>
<p></p>
<span class="segment_title">KanienKehaka</span>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Wars of survival:</span>  The <a href="/popups/glossary/iroquois.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquois',''); return false">Iroquois</a> had been at war with the Native trading partners of New France for generations. They fought to protect their territory, for revenge, or to acquire captives. Fighting, including mourning wars, intensified as the French fueled hostilities between these groups and death from European diseases escalated. After 1650, the French began freely trading guns with enemies of the Iroquois. They and their allies waged war until the Iroquois agreed to negotiate a truce resulting in the Great Peace of 1701.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Curious position:</span> Meanwhile, pro-English, pro-French, and neutralist factions within the <a href="/popups/glossary/iroquois.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquois',''); return false">Iroquois Confederacy</a> struggled over where their alliance should lie. Pro-French factions, including many <a href="/popups/glossary/Kanienkehaka.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kanienkehaka',''); return false">Kanienkehaka</a> (Mohawk), were influenced by Jesuits, a factor in settling <a href="/popups/glossary/Kahnawake.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Kahnawake',''); return false">Kahnawake</a> and <a href="/popups/glossary/La_Montagne.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','La_Montagne',''); return false">La Montagne</a>, in northern <a href="/maps/home_kan.html" onclick="openLink(
        'maps',
        'home_kan',
        ''); return false">Kanienkeh</a>&mdash;in land also claimed by New France. These settlements were in a curious position. Living and trading with the French, these Kanienkehaka integrated elements of French Catholicism with traditional Kanienkehaka beliefs and were expected to participate in French-led attacks on <a href="/popups/glossary/iroquoia.html" onclick="openLink('glossary','Iroquoia',''); return false">Iroquoia</a>. At the same time, they maintained ties to Kanienkehaka family&mdash;English allies&mdash;in the southern part of their homeland. Though sometimes obliging the French, they often avoided attacking the Confederacy. The people of Kahnawake and La Montagne encouraged their kin to relocate north and brought Iroquois captives there, often reuniting families.</p>
<p>
<span class="subHead">Treaty goals:</span> The Kanienkehaka in Kahnawake signed the treaty to avert attacks on their brethren in Iroquoia. The Kanienkehaka still living in southern Iroquoia were conveniently late and did not sign the treaty; another Iroquois nation signed for them. They didn't want to spurn the treaty, but they also didn't wish to alienate their English neighbors and allies.</p>
