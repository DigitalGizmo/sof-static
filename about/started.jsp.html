              website. We suggest that you begin with Getting Started and then 
              proceed in any way that interests you. There is no one right way 
              to view this website. The Home Page gives you four choices to begin:</P>
            <blockquote>

              for exploring the site, remember that in each scene, you can delve

						<strong>Story Menu</strong>: This menu presents a chronological sequence of historic scenes leading up to the raid, the raid itself, and the events and legacies in its aftermath. If you wish, you can move chronologically through all the site's historic scenes using the Story Menu. Each scene is represented by a thumbnail illustration and a brief description. Some scenes, like the Trade scene, link to a menu of several scenes.

              Scenes</span>: Historic scenes provide the foundation for this website. 
              They are a chronology of the forces and events that led up to the 
              raid on Deerfield, the raid itself and its aftermath, and the powerful 
              legacies which influenced the English colonies, the Native peoples, 
              and the French, through the colonial period, and which influence 
              these groups and New England to this day.</p>
            <P CLASS="bigbody">These historic scenes include: Lifeways (W&ocirc;banaki, 
              Wendat, Kanienkehaka, French, English); Trade &amp; Alliance (Springfield, 
              Albany, Quebec); New Communities (W&ocirc;banaki, Wendat, Kanienkehaka, 
              French, English); Assault on Peskeompskut; Great Peace; Attack; 
              March; and Parting Ways; Captivity; Communities Remember; and Legacies. 
              Most of these scenes have the full compliment of glossary links, 
              links to other parts of the website, rollovers, &quot;Related to 
              This Scene&quot; menus, and perspective tabs. Users can choose to 
              read high level information, or delve deeper.</p>

              If the historic scenes provide the foundation for the website, the 
              people narratives provide the heart and soul of the website. They 
              tell the stories of the people behind the raid and in doing so, 
              capture viewers' attention, provoke curiosity, invite involvement 
              and convey layers of meaning. They give life to the W&ocirc;banaki, 
              African, English, Kanienkehaka, Wendat, and French people who played 
              significant roles in this story. These narratives are filled with 
              illustrations, glossary links, footnotes, and links to other parts 
              of the website. While an essay titled &quot;Bringing History to 
              Life: The People in The Many Stories of 1704&quot; explains in general 
              how we created these characters, an &quot;About This Character&quot; 
              description for each person speaks specifically to how that character 
              was created.</p>

							a list of resources for further information. We encourage teachers to

              culture highlight and the rest of the illustration dims; we call 
              this feature &quot;spotlighting.&quot; The "Show all hotspots" feature 
              displays all links in the illustration in yellow when you click 
              the &quot;Show all hotspots&quot; button. When you click the "Show

              without the rollovers.</p>

              Scene Perspective Tabs</span>: When a historic scene is a shared 
              scene, that is, when it represents more than one culture, tabs to 
              the right of the scene display each culture's perspective on the 
              event depicted. For example, for the historic scene &quot;Attack,&quot; 
              all five cultures are represented. However, for the historic scene 
              &quot;Assault on Peskeompskut,&quot; only the English and W&ocirc;banaki 
              tabs are active because only the English and W&ocirc;banaki are 
              present.</p>
              <p>There are two exceptions to this design. For the first two historic scenes&#8212;Lifeways and New Communities&#8212;rather than the tabbed approach, each Lifeway or New Community focuses on just one culture, and therefore no tabs are displayed.</p>
