              <P CLASS="bigbody">Project management is the glue that makes everything 
                work together. It's the imposition of order on an otherwise chaotic 
                mishmash of tasks that must be accomplished. It answers these 
                questions: What are we doing? Why are we doing it? How are we 
                going to do it? Who is going to do it? When are we doing it? How 
                will we know when we've done it? How will we know if it's any 
                good? On any project, one mind needs to be able to hold everything 
                and see the big picture. How is that accomplished? </P>
              <P CLASS="bigbody">The project manager should have experience managing 
                large, multi-faceted projectspreferably online projects (websites, 
                computer-based training, distance learning, etc.). She should 
                have experience talking in the language of online design and development 
                so she speaks the same language as the designer and programmer. 
                She should be familiar with the issues that arise in the area 
                of website content: finding good writers, choosing between a good 
                writer and a subject matter expert, the writing and revision process, 
                the implementation processgetting writing online, reviewed, and 
                revised. She should understand enough of the technology behind 
                the website to be able to grasp the development process, especially 
                when estimating resourcespeople, time, money. She should be a 
                good communicator, a consensus-builder, and a cheerleader. </P>
            <P CLASS="bigbody">We managed the 1704 website project by dividing it into five phases, developing processes for each phase, and then checking to make sure that those processes were followed.

						<P class="segment_title">Planning and Defining the Website</P>
              <P CLASS="bigbody">If you have written a proposal <A href="javascript:openSimpleWindow('default','howto_resources/IMLSproposal.pdf','example')">(see 
                IMLS Proposal, 154K pdf file)</a> and received grant money for 
                your project, you have most likely completed some of your project's 
                planning tasks, at least at a high level. Hopefully, at the very 
                least, you have determined the goals of the project and some ideas 
                of how you are going to accomplish those goals in terms of resources, 
                general timeline, and budget. A key additional task during the 
                planning stage involves preparation for the design and development, 
                or building, phase.</P>
              <P CLASS="bigbody">This preparation include the following tasks:</P>
              <ul CLASS="bigbody">
                <li>Clarification of audience</li>
                <li>Formulation of detailed objectives and outcomes</li>
                <li>Determination of policies</li>
                <li>Detailed outline of development tasks (including a timeline 
                  and schedule with milestones)</li>
                <li>Outline of content and formulation of a writing and review 
                  process</li>
                <li>Definition of responsibilities based on a compilation of resources</li>
                <li>Development of processes (for example, design and development, 
                  writing, reviewing, revision, getting content online, etc., 
                  and standardization of those processes in the form of a Standards 
                  Manual or Writing Guidelines <A href="javascript:openSimpleWindow('default','howto_resources/writing_guide.html','example')">(see

                <li>A process for keeping track of everything</li>
              </ul>
            <P CLASS="bigbody">Often, this phase results in a Project Plan which describes the design, development, and evaluation 
              activities. Or, if your proposal was detailed enough, you may spend 
              a planning stage fine-tuning what was in your proposal.</P>
            <P CLASS="bigbody">We were fortunate to be granted an NEH Planning Grant which allowed us a six-month planning process. During these six months, we were able to bring many of the players from the different cultures to the museum to meet face-to-face and hammer out key content and design issues. It was during one of these meetings that we realized we needed a tab approach to the multiple perspectives of the site, thus allowing each culture to tell its own story.
						</P>

						<a name="build"></a>
            <p class="segment_title">Building the Website</p>
						<P CLASS="bigbody">In the development phase, the team moves into the actual building of the website. It is helpful if the planning phase includes time to develop a number of processes that occur concurrently during the development phase. These processes include communication among members of the project team; the research, writing, review and revision process for content (both text and illustration) creation; implementationor, getting the content into the website; and formative evaluationa process for reviewing the online content and making sure it is correct and "works"both in terms of its accuracy and its functionality.
						</P>
              <P CLASS="bigbody"><span class="subHead">Communication</span><br>
                Communication was a challenge: at various points in the four-year-long 
                project, over 60 people worked part-time on the website, at one 
                point or another, and most of them were scattered geographically. 
                Only the project manager and one part-time historian were resident 
                at the museum. As a result, we held very few in-person meetings. 
                Most of our communication occurred via phone and email and postings 
                to a team website (see screen shot of Team website below). The 
                project manager compiled task lists <A href="javascript:openSimpleWindow('default','howto_resources/scenes_sched.pdf','example')">(see 
                Scene Schedule, 59K pdf file)</a>, (at a later point in time these 
                task lists were replaced by Trackerssee screen shot of Scene 
                Tracker below, and described in greater detail in the Technology 
                section); monitored progress and issued regular status reports; 
                and compiled a Standards Manual that recorded decisions made by 
                the team. Only a few meetings were held at the museum.</P>

            <P CLASS="bigbody"><span class="subHead">Content Development</span><br>
                Content development began in the design phase with a basic categorization 
                of the major kinds of content that we would include. In our case, 
                the kinds of content we created were historical scenes written 
                in a tabbed format, character narratives, labels for artifacts, 
                a voices & songs section, a glossary, brief descriptions of maps, 
                essays, timeline content, and a Teachers' Guide. We listed the 
                content for each category and then developed an outline for the 
                longer pieces. The tasks of identifying, outlining, and writing 
                the content occurred simultaneously. For example, while we were 
                outlining one historical scene, we were busy writing and reviewing 
                and revising another, and putting yet another online. At the same 
                time, we were outlining one character narrative, writing and reviewing 
                and revising another, and putting another online. In some instances, 
                we had more than one writer working on one category of content 
                at a time. We used Trackers to keep track of each of the content 
                areas. </P>
            <P CLASS="bigbody">We hired a variety of writers. Our two historians took on a small part of the writing, but their time was mostly allocated to outlining the content and reviewing other writers' work. Several scholars wrote essays for the website. We hired a writer to write many of the character narratives; we also hired three native scholars for to write narratives of Native people's lives. We hired a material culture expert to track down and write labels for artifacts. The project manager wrote some text and served as an overall editor for most of the content. All text content was reviewed extensively for accuracy and writing style.
						</P>

            <P CLASS="bigbody"><span class="subHead">Review and Revision</span><br>
                We developed a rigorous content review process that spelled out 
                in great detail the steps writers and reviewers had to follow 
                to produce a piece of writing, ready to be put online. For example, 
                for tabbed content, one of our historians filled in a template 
                for each scene's content, <A href="javascript:openSimpleWindow('default','howto_resources/content_template.pdf','example')">(see 
                Content Outline Template, 166K pdf file)</a> the content of which 
                was reviewed by each culture's reviewers. Reviewers were contacted 
                during the planning phase and sent letters <A href="javascript:openSimpleWindow('default','howto_resources/advisor_letter.pdf','example')">(see 
                Advisors' Letter, 47K pdf file)</a> explaining how they should 
                review and give feedback, and how they would be paid. Reviewers 
                from each culture were told that they had to agree among themselves 
                on the changes requested, so that the museum was not in the position 
                of having to mediate among the various voices within each culture. 
                The historian revised the outline based on the feedback and submitted 
                the outline to the writer.</P>
              <P CLASS="bigbody">The writer did research (if necessary) based 
                on the outline, then submitted a draft of the various tabbed perspectives 
                for the historical scene she was writing; at most, there were 
                six tabsthe introduction tab and a tab for each of the five cultures. 
                Advisors for each culture, plus a group of scholars, reviewed 
                the content and submitted revisions. The writer and historian 
                reviewed the feedback, and the writerin consultation with the 
                historianmade the necessary changes. The advisors and scholars 
                reviewed the revised text. All of this review (including directions 
                for how to review and give feedback <A href="javascript:openSimpleWindow('default','howto_resources/review.html','example')">(see 
                Reviewer Directions, 4K html file)</a> took place on the team 
                website, with feedback sent to the project manager who distributed 
                it to the writer and historian. When the content was deemed ready 
                for implementation, the project manager sent it to the implementora 
                college student who worked at a fairly low rate, compared to the 
                programmers of the website. Other pieces of content, including 
                illustrations, were treated in a similar manner. We followed this 
                iterative process for approximately two years. </P>
            <P CLASS="bigbody"><span class="subHead">Implementation</span><br>
							Once a piece of content was ready to be put online, our historian readied the file to be sent to the implementor by doing the following:
						</P>
						<ul CLASS="bigbody">
							<li>Checking proper format, including heads and subhead, footnotes, and further reading in the case of essays and character narratives
							</li>
							<li>Adding glossary term definitions if the writer had not previously done so
							</li>
							<li>In the case of essays, character narratives and some historic scenes, determining the illustrations that would accompany the piece, their location, their captions, and a link from the caption to an artifact label if the illustration illustrated a website artifact
							</li>
						</ul>
              <P CLASS="bigbody">Once the implementor added the content to the 
                development site (See the <a href="howto_tech.jsp.html">Technology</a> 
                section of "How To" to learn how we did this.), the historian 
                and writer reviewed the content and made any necessary changes 
                before the project manager sent an email to the reviewers to review 
                the content online. We instructed reviewers to send feedback to 
                the project manager who, in turn, passed it on to the historian 
                and writer for revisions if necessary. Final changes to the online 
                material were made by the historian, the writer, or the implementor. 
              </P>
						
            <P CLASS="bigbody"><span class="subHead">Standards Manual</span><br>
							A Standards Manual is a written expression of standards that are agreed upon conventions, subject to review, that guide you in developing a website. It should be flexible and serve as a model, or guide, that writers, designers, developers, and programmers can follow in spirit, if not in fact. The content of a Standards Manual should be subject to review and not cast in stone, changing to accommodate new understandings and different project needs. It should be added to, reviewed, evaluated, and changed if necessary, in an ongoing effort to make it current and helpful. The Standards Manual should be a working model and evolving document.  
						</P>
            <P CLASS="bigbody">Why is it helpful to have a Standards Manual? Developing and writing down standards does the following:
						</P>
						<ul CLASS="bigbody">
							<li>Saves us from having to reinvent the wheel each time we add content to the website</li>
							<li>Saves us from having to decide what style and conventions to use, remember them, and undo costly errors that result from misunderstanding, or inaccurately remembering them</li>
							<li>Makes everyone feel a part of the process</li>
							<li>Allows us all to benefit from the combined wisdom of everyones experience</li>
							
                <li>Helps website visitors learn by providing clarity and consistency, 
                  enhancing aesthetics, increasing interactivity and learner control, 
                  making content educationally sound and internally consistent</li>
							<li>Makes the content of a website look like it was written by one person</li>

            <p class="segment_title">Publicizing the Website</p>
						
              <P CLASS="bigbody">Publicity was an important part of our project 
                plan both because we wanted to make sure that people visited our 
                website and because one of our grants was a National Leadership 
                Grant from the Institute for Museum and Library Services. We were 
                charged with the task of disseminating our website as a model 
                for other institutions. Our detailed publicity plan developed 
                over time; it began in the planning phase and in the proposals 
                we wrote, and continued into the design and development phase 
                in the form of a series of meetings with the marketing committee. 
                These are the primary activities we set in motion to publicize 
                the 1704 website. Each activity involved planning, task lists, 
                the allocation of staff time, possible budget considerations (especially 
                in terms of the design), development and distribution of postcards 
                and bookmarks, and an informal assessment of its effectiveness:

            <ul CLASS="bigbody">
              <li>Pre-site: Before the site was launched, we added a "pre-site"

                be. We linked to this "pre-site" from the museum's existing website.</li>
                <li>Video preview and press release: We developed and disseminated

            <P CLASS="segment_title">Evaluating the Website</p>

              <P CLASS="bigbody">As indicated in the evaluation section <A href="javascript:openSimpleWindow('default','howto_resources/evaluation.pdf','example')">(see 
                Evaluation Plan, 46K pdf file)</a> of our proposal, we divided 
                our evaluation activities into two phases: formative evaluation, 
                which tells us how we can make the website better based on user 
                feedback, and summative evaluation, which tells us if the goals 
                of the website are being met. </p>
              <P CLASS="bigbody"><span class="subHead">How Can We Make the Website 
                Better?<br>
                </span>The formative evaluation answered the question "How can 
                we make the website look and work better?" and took place at two 
                key points (pre-public premier: SeptemberFebruary 03; post public 
                premiere: April 03March 05). It was primarily qualitative in 
                nature. We gathered information from observation, interviews, 
                formal focus groups, and questionnaires <A href="javascript:openSimpleWindow('default','howto_resources/questionnaire.pdf','example')">(see 
                Questionnaire, 45K pdf file)</a>. This data allowed us to perform 
                an interface design analysis and, in turn, inform the design and 
                development of the website so that it was constantly refined and 
                fine-tuned to better accomplish its objectives. During this phase 
                we gathered data to answer questions in the following areas: 1) 
                Use - Who is using the site and why?; 2) Usability - Is the user 
                interface easy to navigate? Does the user get lost?; 3) Content 
                and Clarity - Are story lines and terminology clear?; 4) Content 
                Accuracy - Is the content accurate - determined through advisor 
                reviews); 5) Effectiveness of Content and Presentation - What 
                did you learn that you did not already know? How would you improve 
                the website?. </p>
              <P CLASS="bigbody">In all cases, we tried to select a cross-section of users who represented differences in sex, age, geographical location, race, ethnicity, religion, and socio-economic background.  For example, college classrooms offer racial, geographic, ethnic, religious and cultural diversity among men and women students. Local libraries and craft fairs provide participants with ethnic, cultural, religious, socio-economic and age differences among men and women.
						</p>
            <P CLASS="bigbody">In April of 2005, we volunteered our website for a "Crit Session" at the Museums & the Web Conference in Vancouver, Canada. Volunteer judges from other museums evaluated the website primarily in terms of ease of use. This feedback from colleagues proved extremely helpful, since these professionals are both exposed to many similar site issues and have given a lot of thought to the same kinds of challenges that we encountered.
						</p>

              <P CLASS="bigbody"><span class="subHead">Is the Website Meeting 
                Its Goals?</span><br>
                The project manager began summative evaluation in early spring 
                of this 2005, with plans to complete it by the end of September, 
                2005. The evaluation employed both quantitative and qualitative 
                measures to assess the degree to which the website project achieved 
                its goals: </p>
              <ol CLASS="bigbody">
                <li>Has the website reached a large and diverse audience?</li>
                <li>Does the website increase users' knowledge of the event?</li>
                <li>Does the website contribute to a greater awareness of, understanding 
                  of, and/or appreciation for, the various perspectives that define 
                  the historical event?</li>
                 <li>Is the website successful in helping other institutions develop 
                  their own multi-perspective website?</li>
              </ol>

              <P CLASS="bigbody"><span class="subHead">Quantitative Methodology</span>: We gathered 
                web server statistics to measure how the site was being usedfor 
                example, the number of "hits" to the website, most frequently 
                "hit" pages, number of searches and search targets, pages bookmarked, 
                and length of time on the website. Our programmer developed a 
                way to track clicks within a Flash presentation in order to evaluate 
                the extent to which users actually explore multiple perspectives. 
                We also developed an online survey and an online game (developed 
                using Flash) that can yield additional information about respondents' 
                understanding of the multiple perspectives in the website. </p>
              <P CLASS="bigbody">Website statistics:<br>
                We gathered website statistics <A href="javascript:openSimpleWindow('default','howto_resources/2004Webstats.pdf','example')">(see 
                Website Stats, 61K pdf file)</a> using the software program 
                Webtrends. And although you can gain a great deal of detail about 
                traffic on a site using this tool, so far, we have graphed only 
                the following information: number of hits, pages views, visitor 
                sessions, and unique visitors. Hits have relatively little meaning 
                since a hit is tallied for each file of graphics on each page. 
                But number of pages viewed has meaning since it is just thatwhole 
                pages being viewed. The pages viewed number is much greater than 
                visitor session since most visitors view more than one page in 
                a session. Likewise, there are more visitor sessions than unique 
                visitors since a given visitor may come to the site a number of 
                times. </p>
              <P CLASS="bigbody">We can see that when the website launched, we 
                had a great number of page views and visitor sessions; then the 
                numbers dropped off, decreasing from 56,603 and 15,253 respectively, 
                to 18,010 and 6,772. The numbers gradually grew from there, tapering 
                off during the summer when teachers and students are not using 
                the website. Again, in the fall of '04, the numbers rose sharply, 
                coinciding with the opening of school, and then fell off again 
                during the holidays. In 2005, we can see that the numbers took 
                a huge jump in February and March, most likely due to the increase 
                in conference activity, continued publicity around the 1704 commemoration 
                weekend, online articles about the website, and strong continued 
                use by the educational community. </p>
              <P CLASS="bigbody">Preliminary online perspectives tally: <br>
                Periodically, we look at the visits to each of the historic scenes 
                and determine which cultural tabs are visited for each scene. 
                For example, these are the visitation numbers for the Attack scene 
                tabs during a four month time period in the spring of 2005: Intro-1,126; 
                English-290; French-257; Kanienkehaka-251; Wendat-222; Wobanakiak-206. 
                We are able to say that 166 visitors viewed all five cultural 
                perspectives. This is somewhat disappointing until one realizes 
                that these hits include visitors who came to the scene and then 
                decided they did not want to be there. It is also true that some 
                people who visited the English tab did not visit the other tabs. 
                This general pattern of people visiting all the tabs in roughly 
                the same numbers generally holds true for the historical scenes 
                that have more than one perspective. </p>
              <P CLASS="bigbody">Online survey quantitative data: <br>
                All categories were judged on a 7-point scale, with 1 indicating 
                the positive extreme and 7 indicating the negative extreme; for 
                example, ease of finding information was judged 2.3 on a 7-point 
                scale with 1 indicating very easy and 7 indicating very difficult. 
                Here are results during a four-month timeframe in the spring of 
                2005: </p>

              </ul>
              <P CLASS="bigbody"><span class="subHead">Qualitative Methodology</span>: Qualitative 
                methods of data collection include online survey questions, questionnaires 
                filled out by teachers and students, an online game, unsolicited 
                email feedback, and informal comments at conferences and workshops. 
              </p>
              <P CLASS="bigbody">Online survey questions:<br>
                These questions indicate that most respondents came to the website 
                either through school assignments, a research need, or because 
                someone told them about it. Most problems encountered related 
                to slow Internet speed or links not working. When asked the single 
                most important thing that they will remember about the website, 
                the most common responses indicated the multiple perspectives 
                (and non-judgmental nature of the site), the informative content 
                (reasons for the raid, personal stories, struggles, houseplans), 
                and the graphics and illustrations. There was no aspect of the 
                website that stood out as being least liked, although respondents 
                did mention slow speed, links not working, and the need for current 
                information about Deerfield. Suggestions for making the website 
                better included adding character narratives, adding a "graphics-lite" 
                version for people who don't have fast connections, adding a search 
                function, adding more content, and making maps bigger. </p>
              <P CLASS="bigbody">Other questions on the survey yielded information like the following:
						</p>
            <P CLASS="bigbody">When asked what they learned from the website, we can see that some stereotypes were erased, as indicated by this comment:
						</p>
              <blockquote> <span CLASS="bigbody">"I did not know that there were 
                French people with the Indians in the raid. I had only heard the 
                'savage' Indians had attacked."</span>
							</blockquote>
            <P CLASS="bigbody">Two additional questions designed to elicit information about respondent's sensitivity to other perspectives yielded these four comments:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
            <p CLASS="bigbody">"I am more sensitive to others views."<br><br>
							"I feel more strongly about "injustice."<br><br>
							"It is foolish to look at any historical event from one perspective. Great website. We're a Museum Studies class in New Mexico."<br><br>
							"Because I've learned things that I did not know."<br><br>
                </p>
						</blockquote>

              <P CLASS="bigbody">Email feedback:<br>
                Feedback responses through the website have been many and varied. 
                They range from genealogists researching their family trees, to 
                teachers who are using the website in their classrooms, to history 
                scholars from museums. By and large, all comments have been positive, 
                even laudatory. It's a good idea to enable visitors to the website 
                to email someone on the website team; this avenue of informal 
                feedback is both popular with visitors and unstructured enough 
                to allow a variety of responsemuch of it informative and useful, 
                and it allows the web developers to contact the visitor providing 
                the feedback and engage in a dialog, if desired. </P>
