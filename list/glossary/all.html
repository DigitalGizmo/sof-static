    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Aataentsic</SPAN><br>
    In the Wendat creation story, Aetaentsic is Mother Earth, who fell from the Sky-World  to rest on a great turtle and, with the help of the animals, created the world on the turtles back. Aataentsic's daughter gave birth to the twins who completed the job of creating the world and human beings. Aataentsic is associated with the moon, and also with death; she causes humans to die.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Abenaki</SPAN><br>
    The word Abenaki is the English adaptation of the original word W&ocirc;banakiak, meaning &quot;people of the dawn,&quot; or &quot;people of the east.&quot; It generally refers to nothern New England Algonkian peoples of two groups: the Eastern Abenaki of Maine, and the Western Abenaki of New Hampshire and Vermont. Alternate spellings include Abnaki and Banakee. 
See Also: Wabanaki and W&ocirc;banakiak. See also: Maps > W&ocirc;banaki Homelands<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">About Dates</SPAN><br>
    At the time of the raid on Deerfield, the French were using the Gregorian calendar, which we still use today. According to this calendar, the raid took place on March 11, 1704. The English, however, were still using the Julian calendar, which was 11 days behind, hence February 29. Under the Julian calendar, the dating of the New Year began on March 25. Aware of the fact that the rest of western Europe dated the beginning of the New Year on January 1, the English usually wrote the date February 29, 1703/04. <BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Agawam</SPAN><br>
    The Agawam are a Native American Indian group who speak an eastern Algonkian language. Their homeland is situated around present-day Springfield, Massachusetts, on the Connecticut River.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Aientsik</SPAN><br>
    In the Kanienkehaka creation story, Aientsik is Mother Earth, who fell from the Sky-World  to rest on a great turtle and, with the help of the animals, created the world on the turtle's back.

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Algonkian</SPAN><br>
    Algonkian or Algonquian are terms used by anthropologists and historians to refer to a large cultural and linguistic group of Native American Indian peoples. The original Algonkian homelands include present-day New England, the Great Lakes, the Hudson River valley, most of Canada, and parts of the upper Plains. On this website, we discuss the W&ocirc;banakiak who are an Algonkian people. Traditional Algonkian lifeways include seasonal and group use of communal hunting, fishing, gathering, planting, and homesites within a broad homeland. Algonkian political and social structures include both male and female chiefs or sachems, and various inter-tribal councils, alliances and confederacies.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Algonkian (Algonquian)</SPAN><br>
    Linguists use the term Algonkian (variously spelled Algonquian) to refer to the languages and culture of Indian peoples, grouped as Plains, Central, and Eastern Algonkian. Eastern Algonkian speakers include Abenaki, Mohegan, Mohican, Narragansett, Nipmuc, Pennacook, Penobscot, Pequot, Pocumtuck, Schaghticoke and Wampanoag, among others.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Algonquin</SPAN><br>
    The tribal name Algonquin indicates a group of closely related bands living north of the St. Lawence, in the Ottawa valley of present-day Ontario and Quebec, between the Montagnais and Nipissing. Culturally and linguistically, they are Central Algonkian. These Algonquin bands include the Weskarini, Matouweskarini, Kichespirini, and Kotakoutouemi.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Algonquin/Algonquian/Algonkian - word origin</SPAN><br>
    The words Algonquin, Algonquian, and Algonkian are all derived from the Wbanaki language word elakomkwik, meaning they are our relatives or allies. Europeans took  the word Algonquin from one of three possible sources: the Maliseet word elakomkwik meaning they are our relatives or allies; the Motagnais word Algoumequin meaning those who paint themselves red, or the Maliseet word elagankwin  meaning they are dancing.  <BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Anishinaabe</SPAN><br>
    Anishinaabe is a word that roughly translates to mean "the people." The Native peoples called Anishinaabe are also known as the Ojibway or Chippewa, words that come from neighboring Native languages and not from the Anishinaabe. Culturally and linguistically, they are Central or Great Lakes Algonkian.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Arendahronon</SPAN><br>
    The Arendahronon or Rock Nation was one of the nations in the Wendat (Huron) Confederacy. The Wendat are an Iroquoian people in language and culture whose original homeland is Wendake, near Georgian Bay of Lake Huron.<BR><BR>

    The Aroostook band of Mi'kmaq (Micmac) people, in the northwest region of what is now the state of Maine, are one of the four tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy situated in Maine, and the only band of Mikmaq recognized in the United States. Culturally and linguistically, they are eastern Algonkian and eastern Abenaki or Wbanaki. They are most closely related to the Mi'kmaq of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Arosaguntacook</SPAN><br>
    The Wbanaki word Arosekantegouk, also spelled Anosagunticook, literally translates to empty cabin river. This is the earliest recorded name for the Wbanaki village site on the St. Francis River, near the St. Lawrence, now known as Odanak or St. Francis. It is unknown whether it is the original name of the village. Arosekantegouk may be a name that recalls the emptying of the village after an Iroquois attack in 1690 and a plague in 1700.
<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Ataronchronon</SPAN><br>
    The Ataronchronon or "people of the marshes" were one of the nations in the Wendat (Huron) Confederacy. The Wendat are an Iroquoian people in language and culture whose original homeland is Wendake, near Georgian Bay of Lake Huron.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Atiwendaron</SPAN><br>
    The Atiwendaron (Neutral) are an Iroquoian people whose language was apparently similar to that of the Wendats (Hurons), as the name means "people who speak a slightly different language." They lived at the western end of Lake Ontario, and were a confederacy of several nations. The French called them the Neutral because they did not take sides in the conflicts between the Wendat and Iroquois Confederacies.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Attignawantan</SPAN><br>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Baptism</SPAN><br>
    A ceremony in which a priest pours water, in the name of the Trinity, over the head of a child or adult, cleansing the individual of sin.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Baptist</SPAN><br>
    The Baptist movement had its origins among 17th-century English Puritans and their Calvinist traditions.  Baptists broke with Puritans in their adherence to the Anabaptist doctrine that only adult believers should be baptized.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Bed-tester</SPAN><br>
    A fabric canopy hung over the bed.  Often there were bed curtains which hung down from the tester and could be drawn closed to help keep people in the bed warm.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Before Current Era</SPAN><br>
     The terms B.C.E. (Before Current Era) and C.E. (Current Era) are non-denominational dating systems for historical events. The dominant Euro-American system  A.D. (Anno Domini- in the year of our Lord), and B.C. (Before Christ)  is based on the Christian faith.<BR><BR>

    Native peoples of the seventeenth and eighteenth century would sometimes refer to Jesuit priests as "Black Robes".<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Bloody Brook</SPAN><br>
    Bloody Brook is the site where a group of several hundred warriors successfully ambushed a convoy of English militia and teamsters carting grain from Deerfield to Hadley during Metacoms War (1675-1676). Sixty English and over 100 warriors were killed in the initial attack and subsequent battle, which the English later named the Bloody Brook massacre.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Breeches</SPAN><br>
    Knee-length pants worn by 17th/18th-century English men. Boys were "breeched" -- allowed to wear breeches instead of the petticoats and gowns worn by toddlers -- when they were six or seven years old. Breeches had a button fly and pockets, and often buttoned at the knee as well. <BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Brick nogging</SPAN><br>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Bridewealth</SPAN><br>
    In some African cultures, a groom made substantial bridewealth payments to a bride and her family as part of the bonds of marriage. This custom was reflected among slaves in the Americas, who sometimes consecrated marriages by giving the bride a gift--or procured a wife by buying her freedom.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Calumet</SPAN><br>
    Large ceremonial tobacco pipe made of red, black or white catalanite and a reed stem of upwards of two feet.  Calumets originated in the middle of the North American continent. Their use had spread to peoples east of the Great Lakes region by the late seventeenth century.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Canadiens</SPAN><br>
    French colonists born in New France. Although they continued to be subjects of the King of France, Canadiens were distinguished by their
birth in New France. Canadiens developed several distinct colonial characters, including farmers (habitants), who were more independent than their peasant counterparts in France; fur
traders, who learned Native ways of traveling, fighting, and surviving in the woods; and nobles, whose military careers were spent leading mixed troops of Natives, militia, and regular soldiers.
<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Captain Thomas Lathrop</SPAN><br>
    Captain Thomas Lathrop was the leader of a company of 80 militia men from Essex county, in eastern Massachusetts, sent to defend the town of Hadley. On September 18, 1675, a group of warriors led by the Nipmuc leader, Muttawampa, ambushed Lathrop's company, and a group of Deerfield teamsters, carting grain from Deerfield to Hadley during Metacoms War (1675-1676). Sixty English and over 100 Native warriors were killed in the initial attack and ensuing battle, which the English later named the "Bloody Brook massacre".<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Card wool</SPAN><br>
    A step in the process of preparing wool for spinning is "carding." A fleece would first be cleaned and then "carded," or brushed, to remove tangles. Cards are thin pieces of wood that have handles and are covered on one side with wire teeth or bristles. The wool would then be rolled off of the card and this roll would be ready for spinning into yarn.
<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Catechism</SPAN><br>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Catholicism</SPAN><br>
    Catholicism is generally used to refer to the Roman Catholic Church, whose members believe that the bishop of Rome (the Pope) is the supreme earthly religious authority. The word catholic is derived from the Greek word katholikos, meaning "universal" and hearkens back to the days when it was the sole Christian church. The Roman Catholic Church is believed by its members to be the only true inheritor, via the unbroken line of bishops (Popes) from St. Peter on down, of the authority given by Jesus Christ to his twelve apostles. Bitter religious conflict divided the Catholic Church in the 16th century, when Protestants broke away from the church to follow their own, alternative vision of a purer church. Although there were French Protestants, the country as a whole was considered a Catholic country and alternative religious practices were forbidden in New France. England and the bulk of its people, including those living in English colonial settlements like Deerfield, were in contrast, staunchly Protestant. <BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Cayuga</SPAN><br>
    The Cayuga nation is one of the five original nations of the Iroquois Confederacy or Rotinonsionni (People of the Longhouse). The Cayuga homeland lies between the Onondaga and the Seneca.

This large group includes the Great Lakes Algonkians, such as the Anishinaabe (also known as the Ojibway or Chippewa), Kickapoo, Nipissing, Potawatomi, and Winnebago. It also includes the Algonkians just east of the Mississippi River, such as the Fox, Peoria, Illinois and Miami. <BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Cession contract</SPAN><br>
    A cession contract is a written and notarized agreement between the seigneur and the settler that conveys the land to settler and lays out the obligations of both parties.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Charter</SPAN><br>
    An official document from the English monarch granting rights and privileges such as rights to govern, economic privileges and legal protections to a colony.

    In Northern Iroquoian cultures, a clan is a kinship grouping made up of two or more maternal (longhouse) families that trace their descent from a common female ancestor. People consider themselves related to members of their clan, even those from different nations. All nations of the Rotinonsionni or Iroquois Confederacy have Bear, Wolf, and Turtle clans; some of these nations also share the Snipe, Beaver, Hawk, Deer, Eel, and Heron. Each nation of the Wendat Confederacy shares the Turtle, Wolf, Bear, Deer, Beaver, Hawk, Porcupine, and Snake clans.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Coffle</SPAN><br>
    From the Arabic for caravan; a train of slaves or animals fastened together.  <BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Condolence Ceremony</SPAN><br>
    A foundation of the Iroquois Confederacy or Rotinonsionni, the Condolence Ceremony is an important part of Confederacy Councils. If a Confederacy Chief has died, a new one is appointed and given the same name/title as the deceased, and the Condolence Ceremony is performed to console the bereaved and invest the new chief with the deceased's power. In the village context, members of the opposite moiety (clan grouping) help "wipe away the tears" of the bereaved family by conducting funeral rituals, providing feasts, and bestowing gifts. Wampum strings are an essential part of condolence rituals.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Conference at Deerfield, Mass., 1735</SPAN><br>
    In August of 1735, Massachusetts Governor Jonathan Belcher held a conference at Deerfield with Mohican, Wbanaki and Kanienkehaka peoples to discuss diplomatic relations in Massachusetts. The group included 60 Schaghticoke Indians (who were actually Agawam, Nonotuck, Pocumtuck, Sokoki and Woronoco from the Connecticut River valley), 40 Housatonic (Mohican), 25 St. Francis Abenaki (including Missisquoi, Pennacook and Pequawket), and 8 Kanienkehaka (Mohawk) from Kahnawake. Belcher agreed to establish a mission village at Stockbridge for the Housatonic and set up a truck house at Fort Dummer for the Wbanaki. In the months leading up to the conference, a number of Sokoki were convinced to sell land in northern Massachusetts and move to Odanak.<BR><BR>

    Coureurs de bois, literally "runners in the woods," were unlicensed fur traders in New France. After the fur market became glutted in the 1690s, French traders were prohibited from traveling and trading in the northwestern Great Lakes area. Coureurs de bois defied this prohibition, and were also involved in illegal fur trade with the English at Albany and the Kanienkehaka. <BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Covenant Chain</SPAN><br>
    A set of English-Native alliances, primarily between the English colonial government of New York and the Iroquois Confederacy.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Cow-commons</SPAN><br>
    A unit of land based on the division into shares of land held in common by the inhabitants of Dedham, Massachusetts. Dedham proprietors were granted the land at Pocumtuck that became Deerfield, so Deerfield land was also divided into cow-commons. The shares were based "partly on the tax list and partly on the number of cattle running on the commons," according to Deerfield historian George Sheldon, who also says that "Fractions were reckoned by 'sheep and goat commons,' five of which equalled one 'cow common.'"<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Cowass</SPAN><br>
    Cowass, meaning "pine tree place," refers to the Wbanaki community centered at the bend in the Connecticut River near present-day Newbury, Vermont.
See Also: Maps > The Northeast<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Cowasuck</SPAN><br>
    The Cowasuck are the Native peoples of Cowass, the place of the pine tree. The center of their traditional homeland is at present-day Newbury, Vermont, near a bend in the upper Quinneticook (Connecticut River). Culturally and linguistically, they are eastern Algonkian Indians, and are considered part of the Western Abenaki. They were closely allied with the Pennacook and Sokoki, and provided refuge for Connecticut River Valley Indians such as the Pocumtuck. After the 1704 raid on Deerfield, Wattanummon took his captive Stephen Williams to winter camp at Cowass.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Creole</SPAN><br>

Wbanakiak in present-day Vermont and New Hampshire were often called "Western Indians." During the 1704 attack on Deerfield, Deerfield's minister, John Williams, made a distinction between "Eastern Indians" (meaning Pennacook), and "Indians" (meaning Native peoples from the Connecticut Valley, Vermont, and the village of Odanak or St. Francis, in Canada).

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Five Nations Iroquois Confederacy</SPAN><br>
    Five Native nations comprised the Rotinonsionni, which is the Kanienkehaka word for Haudenosaunee, and also known as the Five Nations Iroquois Confederacy. Metaphorically, the founders of Confederacy spoke of the people as all agreeing to live under the rafters of one great "longhouse." The members of the Confederacy are, from east to west, the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk), Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca. The Tuscaroras, joined the League in the 1720s to make it the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy.

    The fur trade era in North America began in the 17th century, when Dutch, English, and French traders competed with one another to secure beaver, deer, bear, and other valuable furs from Native hunters and trappers, in exchange for European goods and wampum. Over time, as the beaver became scarce, Native traders found themselves increasingly in debt to Europeans. The fur trade continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, spreading across the continent with Hudsons Bay and other companies employing Native guides, hunters, and trappers.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Homelands</SPAN><br>
    Anthropologists use this term to describe the traditional way in which the Native peoples of the Northeast identified territories. Rather than living within permanent village sites or fixed territorial boundaries, Algonkian peoples use a variety of sites within a large area. For both Algonkian and Iroquoian peoples, homelands include all of the homesites, hunting territories, fishing places, planting grounds, burial places, spritual sites regularly or seasonally used by a Native people. Different homelands may, in some areas, be shared or overlap.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Hoosic</SPAN><br>
    Hoosic, a Mohican word apparently meaning rock place, is applied to both a mountain in the Berkshires and a village place east of the Hudson River.

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Huguenots</SPAN><br>
    Huguenot was the name given to Protestants of France in the mid-16th century.  Between 1562 and 1598 eight wars were fought between the Huguenots and French Catholics.   Peace came with the Edict of Nantes, which was instituted in 1598 and gave equal rights to Catholics and Protestants in France. In 1685, King Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes and French persecution drove up to one million Huguenots out of France.  Many settled in England, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as the English colonies, however, Huguenots were prohibited from settling in New France.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Huron</SPAN><br>
    Huron is the name the French called the Wendats, a confederacy of northern Iroquoian people whose homeland is a peninsula in Georgian Bay of Lake Huron in present-day Ontario, Canada. The Wendats, meaning "island (or peninsula) dwellers," are also known as Wyandots. The Wendats (Huron) who joined the 1704 raid on Deerfield, were a group much reduced by epidemic and war with the Rotinonsionni (Iroquois Confederacy), who had moved from their homeland of Wendake to the mission village of Lorette near Quebec City. The Wendats (Huron) continue to live in the Quebec, Canada, town of Lorette, now called Wendake, and on reservations in Oklahoma, in the United States.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Iroquoian Green Corn Festival/Ceremony</SPAN><br>
    The Green Corn Festival is second only to the Midwinter Festival in its importance among Rotinonsionni (Iroquois) ceremonial celebrations. Held over several days in August when the first corn is ready to eat, the Green Corn Festival honors the Corn Mother as well as the Master of Life. It is a time for giving names: to babies born since the Midwinter Festival, to children ready for adult names, and to adults adopting new names for various reasons.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Iroquois - word origin</SPAN><br>
    The words Iroquois and Iroquoian are used by anthropologists to refer to a large group of Native peoples including the Wendat (Huron) and the members of the Six Nations Confederacy. The word Iroquois is the European pronunciation of the Algonkian term irnokue or irokue, meaning terrible man.  In 1609, explorer Samuel de Champlain asked his Algonkian allies who the Native people living in present-day New York state were. He was told they were Irokue.

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Iroquois of the Mountain</SPAN><br>
    Iroquois of the Mountain is the term given to the Native peoples living at Sault-au-R&eacute;collet and La Montagne at the time of the 1704 Deerfield raid.  At the time, these communities were comprised of individuals from the nations of the Iroquois Confederacy as well as Wendat and some Algonkian peoples.  These villages relocated after 1720 to the Lake of Two Mountains and eventually became the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk) community of Kanesatake.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Jesuit</SPAN><br>
     A member of the religious male order of the Society of Jesus of the Roman Catholic Church. Founded in 1534, the orders Latin motto is Ad majorem Dei gloriam (to the greater glory of God.) The primary mission of the Jesuits was (and is) to spread the Roman Catholic church though preaching and education in particular. Jesuit missionaries were among the earliest Europeans seeking to convert Native Americans to Christianity. The Jesuit Relations of the 1600s record these efforts as well as individual Jesuits observations of the Native people among whom they lived. Their ability to speak Native languages made Jesuits valuable and influential players in diplomatic relations between the French government and Native peoples. <BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">John A. Gibson (1849-1912)</SPAN><br>
    John A. Gibson was a Condoled Seneca chief, and an accomplished Onondaga speaker. He was a member of the Committee of Chiefs in Ohsweken on the Grand River (west of Toronto) that drafted an English version of the Great Law in 1900, and published it in Canada a few years later. It was published again in the U.S., along with that of Seth Newhouse (Mohawk), by Arthur C. Parker (Seneca) in 1912. Gibson was not satisfied with either version and worked on a much longer one in Onondaga which finally got translated and published, eighty years after his death, in 1992. A gifted Rotinonsionni (Iroquois) ritualist and intellectual, Gibson also dictated the longest written version of the Rotinonsionni creation story which also was published in both Onondaga and English in 1928 by J. N. B. Hewitt (Tuscarora).<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Kahnawake</SPAN><br>
    A number of Kanienkehaka (Mohawk) and other Iroquois and their adopted kin left their villages in the heart of Iroquoia during the 1660s to reassert the northern boundary of their homeland on the south banks of the St. Lawrence River. The possibility of better trade opportunities with the French in Montreal and the influence of Jesuits, who persuaded a number of their converts to live in territory claimed by New France, also encouraged these Iroquois to relocate along the St. Lawrence.  Although Kahnawake had a nationally diverse population in its early years, the community eventually took on a wholly Kanienkehaka character. Kahnawake means "by the rapids;" the rapids are presently a short distance down river.

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">King Philip</SPAN><br>
    Metacom, or "King Philip" as he was known to the English, was a son of Massasoit. King Philip's War (1675-1676) was a tragic event in Native American/Colonial relations. It killed an estimated eight hundred English and dozens of towns were destroyed and abandoned.

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Loups</SPAN><br>
    During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the French in Canada used the term Loups, meaning wolves, for several different Native Nations. It was sometimes used to describe the Mohegan people, since their tribal name translated to mean wolf people. More confusingly, the name Loup was also applied to Native people who had relocated from the Connecticut River Valley to Canada, since, from the French perspective, they were roaming like wolves. Father Mathevet recorded the language of Pocumtuck people living in a French mission in the 1740s and called it Mots Loups meaning wolf words.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Middle Passage</SPAN><br>
    The Middle Passage was the second leg of the infamous triangle trade that brought enslaved Africans to the Americas. Most of the slave trade journeys originated in Europe. Ships brought European goods -- cloth, brandy, guns, iron -- to West Africa, where the goods were exchanged for Africans. Enslaved Africans were brought to the Americas in the most inhumane conditions imaginable, hundreds of them chained and crammed together in the filthy holds of the ships. In North and South America and the Caribbean, the human cargo was exchanged for sugar, tobacco, and the like, which was then brought to Europe on the third leg of the triangle.<BR><BR>

    The Iroquoian people commonly known as Mohawk are called &quot;Kanienkehaka&quot; in their language, which means &quot;People of the Flint.&quot; The latter has become a preferred term since the appellation Mohawk, adopted by the Europeans, comes with pejorative meanings from historic Algonkian enemies. The Kanienkehaka are the &quot;Keepers of the Eastern Door&quot; of the Rotinonsionni (Iroquois Confederacy) which includes the Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora nations. The Kanienkehaka who participated in the 1704 raid on Deerfield were from Kahnawake, La Montagne, and Sault-au-R&eacute;collet (present-day Kanesatake), villages on the St. Lawrence River at the northern edge of their homeland that were founded by people who moved from the Mohawk Valley beginning in the 1670s.

    The Mohawk-Mohican war was a long series of struggles and shifting alliances over access to the Dutch trade in the Hudson River valley. Between 1609 and 1624, the Mohican controlled access to the Dutch traders and forced their Kanienkehaka Mohawk neighbors to pay tribute. The power dynamic changed after the Mohawk, with the aid of Dutch guns and French allies, attacked the Mohican in 1624. The Mohican were forced to vacate the lands west of the Hudson River, and pay tribute to the Mohawk. In 1662, the Mohican were again attacked by the Mohawk, and in 1663, the Mahican joined with the Sokoki in striking back.

    The term Plains Algonkian or Algonquian refers to those Native peoples in the north-central Plains, such as the Blackfoot or Blackfeet, who are linguistically similar to the Algonkian peoples of New England and Canada. <BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Pocket</SPAN><br>
    In the early 18th century, pockets were not integrated into women's clothes. Pockets were separate items attached to strings that tied around the waist. They were worn under gowns and petticoats, which had slits that allowed for access to them. Pockets carried and  concealed personal or valuable items.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Pocumtuck</SPAN><br>
    The word Pocumtuck or Pocumpetook, meaning swift, shallow, sandy river, is the original name for the river now known as the Deerfield. The homelands of the Native people known as Pocumtuck include present-day Deerfield and Greenfield, Massachusetts. Culturally and linguistically, they are eastern Algonkian Indians. During the late 17th and early 18th century, many of them relocated to Schaghticoke and northern Wbanaki communities. <BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Podunk</SPAN><br>
    The Algonkian word Podunk indicates a boggy place where one sinks in. As a tribal name, it refers to the Native homelands just north of present-day Hartford, Connecticut and south of Agawam homelands in Springfield, Massachusetts. The Podunk were sometimes allies of the Pocumtuck. Culturally and linguistically, they are eastern Algonkian.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Popery</SPAN><br>
     A derogatory term used by early Protestants to describe the religious practices of Roman Catholics. Protestants, including those living in Deerfield considered sinful the Roman Catholic belief in the infallibility of the Pope and other rituals of the church, including the mass. Protestants believed they were purifying their own church by purging these elements from their religious practices and beliefs. The people living in Deerfield in 1704 were strongly Protestant and thus were especially hostile to the Roman Catholic faith.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Post Nati</SPAN><br>
    Post nati is a Latin term meaning "after birth."<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Praying Indians</SPAN><br>
    During the 1660s, central and southern New England Algonkian peoples who adopted Christianity were called, by their English neighbors, Praying Indians. The term was also used for Wbankiak in northern New England and Canada who converted to the Catholic faith. During the late 18th and 19th century, the Christian Brothertown Indians were also sometimes called Praying Indians.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Praying Villages</SPAN><br>
    Some Christian Indians in New England relocated to praying villages, which were organized like English villages. The English minister John Eliot set up a number of praying villages for Nipmuc, Massachusetts, Pawtucket and Pennacook peoples in the 1660s. Other praying Indian villages were founded among the Wampanoag on Marthas Vineyard. Praying Indians built private homes, set aside town commons for grazing, and, for the most part, gave up seasonal travel. During King Philips War, many Christian Native peoples were forcibly removed by the English to an internment camp on Deer Island, where many died, and their land was claimed by English settlers. <BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Predestination</SPAN><br>
    The doctrine that God, because of his knowledge of all events that will happen, infallibly chooses those who are destined for salvation.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Priesthood of All Believers</SPAN><br>
    The belief that each individual stood in a direct relationship with God in the matter of salvation and needed no mediator such as a priest. The belief empowered the laity, while undercutting the sacerdotal claims of the clergy and justifications for clerical hierarchies.  <BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Protestant</SPAN><br>
     From the word protest, Protestants are Christians who initially sought to reform, but who by the 1500s began to deny the ecclesiastical authority of the Roman Catholic Church. Protestants rejected the doctrine that the Pope was the divinely-appointed and infallible earthly head of the Christian church. They also rejected the authority of priests to forgive sins, believing God alone held this power. Protestants in general elevated the authority of the Bible above that of individual priests and other clerics. Members of the Protestant sects who settled in New England were in general a hotter sort of Protestant, devoted to purging their faith practices and rituals they believed inappropriate or sinful. Such people earned the derisive term Puritans from less fervent contemporaries.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Puritan</SPAN><br>
    The practices and beliefs of English Protestants dedicated to purifying the Protestant Church of England. Puritanism was the English manifestation of the stern and unyielding theology of John Calvin, including the belief that all humans were totally depraved from birth. Several other tenets of Puritanism flowed from this fundamentally pessimistic view of human nature. Puritanism taught that spiritual salvation was not universal. Those chosen by God were powerless to choose or reject salvation that was permanent as well as irresistible. Together, these Calvinist assumptions fostered "predestination," the belief that God has already determined who will be saved and everything that happens in this world. Critics of this form of Protestantism labeled its English followers Puritans.

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Schaghticoke</SPAN><br>
    In 1676, Governor Edmond Andros of New York set aside the village called Schaghticoke, east of the Hudson River, near the mouth of the Hoosic River, for Native refugees from the Connecticut River valley. The village was in Mohican territory, under the protection of the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk) of New York state. During the late 17th century, many Agawam, Nonotuck, Pocumtuck, Sokoki and Woronoco people circulated between Schaghticoke and northern Wbanaki villages. By 1763, most Native families had left Schaghticoke and it became an English town.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Schaghticoke Indians</SPAN><br>
    During the 17th century, the term Schaghticoke Indians could mean any of several different groups of Native peoples. It could mean the Schaghticoke tribe of northwestern Connecticut. It could also mean the village of Schaghticoke on the Hoosic River at two different time periods: the Mohican village before 1676, or the refugee village after 1676. Between 1676 and 1763, many Connecticut River valley Indians living temporarily at Schaghticoke were called Schaghticoke Indians in colonial records.  This website primarily refers to this latter group of Schaghticoke people.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Schaghticoke Tribe</SPAN><br>
    The name Schaghticoke comes from the Algonkian word Pishgoch-ti-goch, meaning where the waters meet. The homelands of the tribe originally known as Schaghticoke are in the northwest corner of Connecticut, around the Housatonic River. A number of Potatuck, Podunk, and Tunxis people are included among the Schaghticoke. Culturally and linguistically, they are eastern Algonkian Indians.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Seigneur</SPAN><br>
    A seigneur is a landlord, an owner of land (a seigneury) granted by the king. In New France, seigneurs were members of the nobility, prominent men who were not nobles, and church institutions. Seigneurs in New France rented their lands to settlers, but unlike their counterparts in medieval Europe, did not have political power over the people who worked their land. <BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Seigneuries</SPAN><br>

    This confederacy was a loose political organization of Algonkian and Iroquoian groups living along the St. Lawrence River who had diplomatic relationships with each other and who were allied to the French. These Nations were also allies of the Five Nations Iroquois Confederacy in New York state, but were not politically part of the Iroquois. The Seven Fires Confederacy included the Wendat (Huron) at Wendake, the Nipissing, and the St. Francis Wbanakiak (Abenaki), along with the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk) at Kanesetake, Kahnawake, and Akwesasne, and the Onondaga of Oswegatchie. It became more formalized following the English conquest of New France in 1760. This confederacy is also known as the "Seven Nations."

Brlart de Sillery set up one of the earliest Jesuit missions that attracted W&ocirc;banaki converts, including Montagnais, Algonkin, and Kennebec. By 1676, 150 W&ocirc;banaki people were living at Sillery, and the mission also started attracting Connecticut River valley refugees. In 1701, after Jesuit missionaries moved the mission church of Saint Franois de Sales from the Chaudire River, many of the W&ocirc;banakiak at Sillery moved to Odanak or St. Francis.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy</SPAN><br>
    Six Native nations comprise the Rotinonsionni, which is the Kanienkehaka word for Haudenosaunee, and also known as the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy. Metaphorically, the founders of the original Five Nations spoke of the people as all agreeing to live under the rafters of one great "longhouse." The members of the Confederacy are, from east to west, the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk), Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, joined by the Tuscarora nation in the 1720s.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Skamon</SPAN><br>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">St. Francis</SPAN><br>
    The village of St. Francis, also known as Odanak, is located on the St. Francis River, in the St. Lawrence River Valley of Quebec, Canada. In the 1660s, the Wbanaki village at this site was called Arosikantegouk or Anosagunticook. During the late 17th century, a number of Sokoki, followed by Pocumtuck, Pennacook, Woronoco and other New England Natives, moved to Odanak. It became a Catholic village in 1701, when Jesuit missionaries moved their mission church, Saint Franois de Sales, from its location on the Chaudire River to Odanak. 
By 1704, Odanak was a sizeable Wbanaki village, with about 400 residents representing Native communities from across northern and central New England, who still maintained ties with their homelands. Due to the large proportion of Missisquoi and Sokoki people, the Wbanaki dialect known as Western Abenaki became the dominant language of the village.

    A wooden cage-like support, either square or round, for young children. Standing stools held children upright with their feet on the floor and the upper part of the stool under the arms. The standing stool served two purposes: to keep children from crawling, which was viewed in the 17th and early 18th centuries to be "animalistic," and to keep them from harming themselves by crawling into the fire or other dangers.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Stays</SPAN><br>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">Stockade</SPAN><br>
     A 10-12 foot high wall erected for the purposes of defense. The wall was usually built using closely spaced logs or wooden stakes. The close spacing of the logs in the stockade at Deerfield diminished its effectiveness as a barrier when deep snows drifted up against the wall made it easier for attackers to scale. The Englishmen who built the stockade in 1743 around the fortified village of Fort Number Four in what is today Charlestown, New Hampshire, were careful not to repeat this mistake. They made a point of spacing the individual logs farther apart.<BR><BR>

During the 1640s-60s, Uncas was at war with the Pocumtuck, and made several raids into the Connecticut River Valley.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">United Colonies</SPAN><br>
    The United Colonies was a union for "mutual safety and welfare" formed in 1643 by representatives of the colonies of Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven.

Traditionally, shell beads were two colors  white and dark purple, carved from periwinkles (Pyrula carica), and clams or quahaugs (Venus mercenaria). Dark purple wampum beads were called suckauhock, black shell. Wampum beads were used for personal adornment, trade, tribute, and ceremony. Shell beads were strung together or woven into belts that were used symbolically to mark treaties, send messages, and serve as mnemonics and marks of authority for speakers during councils and ceremonies. Wampum was also used, during the fur trade, by both Native peoples and Europeans, as a substitute for money.<BR><BR>

    <SPAN CLASS="subHead">War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1713)</SPAN><br>
    England and France spent much of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries struggling for control of Europe's economy and political landscape. At various points, this ongoing rivalry escalated into full-scale war. In 1700, Carlos II, the King of Spain died. Carlos named the grandson of King Louis XIV of France his heir. This action brought Spain firmly under the control of France and radically increased French power. England and its allies found Carlos II's will unacceptable and declared war on France in 1701, known as the War of Spanish Succession. The conflict quickly spread to the North American colonies, where it became known to English colonists as Queen Anne's War, after the newly crowned Queen of England. Both the French and English colonial governments called on Native American allies to join them in attacking enemy settlements. By 1713 England had gained the upper hand over France, winning both new territory and trade concessions in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713).
